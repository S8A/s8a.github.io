introduction: >
  I'm an informations systems engineer (graduated in 2023) and self-taught
  software developer from Venezuela. I've worked as a software developer 
  both as an employee and as a freelancer, besides coding for personal projects.
  I started to teach myself how to code and make websites when I was 13 years
  old, and I also taught myself to become very proficient in English.


  I'm currently working primarily as a full-stack developer, building web apps
  using Django and Vue.js, custom modules for the Odoo business software
  platform, REST APIs, and integrations with services like Stripe and Zoho CRM.
  Check out the [about page](/about/) to learn more about my skills, work
  experience, and education.


  Besides programming for work, I also have a variety of personal and
  university projects that I've worked on over the years. Check out the
  [projects page](/projects/) to learn more about them, or go to
  [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/S8A) to see my code directly.


  Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration opportunities, software
  development projects, or any other professional inquiries.
