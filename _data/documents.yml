  name: Solow-Swan growth model
  date: 2019-05-27
  summary: "A Calculus 4 assignment about the application of differential 
  equations, made in Geogebra. In this interactive document I explored the 
  Solow-Swan economic growth model, which is a nonlinear system consisting 
  of a single ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of 
  the per capita stock of capital."
