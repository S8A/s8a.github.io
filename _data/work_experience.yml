    I developed a simple Django web app for Totto Market, a local convenience
    store specialized in gluten-free products, and deployed it on Heroku. The
    web app consisted of a product list, a list of customers with bills pending
    payment, and forms for uploading the data, which is exported from the
    business's accounting software at the end of each day.
