    I'm currently involved in the development of multiple projects for
    Bitmotto's business customers, working both backend and frontend:
    single-page style web applications built with Django, Vue.js, and
    Inertia.js; and custom modules for the Odoo business management software
    platform. In many cases, I've been responsible for designing and
    implementing integrations between different systems. Previously, I worked
    on the development of Bitmotto's white-label crypto exchange and remittance
    platforms.
  sections:
    - title: Yummy Rides integration for Odoo
      items:
        - Developed an Odoo module that integrates Yummy Rides, a Venezuelan
          delivery service, as a delivery carrier for sale orders created
          from the Sales and eCommerce apps, handling the operations for
          getting the estimated rate, creating the actual delivery order,
          automatically tracking the delivery status, and generating a custom
          shipping label in PDF format.
        - Created a complementary module that implements a Leaflet map
          as an Owl component, allowing e-commerce customers to select the exact
          location of the delivery address on the map (as Yummy uses GPS
          coordinates for the source and destination addresses), as well as
          automatically finding the coordinates from the address fields or
          filling the address fields from the coordinates.
    - title: OTC Management System
      items:
        - Developed a Django web application for Wedlake International S.A., a
          Panamanian currency exchange company with subsidiaries across Latin
          America, which allows them to keep track of the operations that they
          carry out, check the balances of their accounts and their clients',
          and view graphs of certain metrics.
        - Refactored the system to create a new user type with limited
          permissions for account brokers, add the feature of uploading
          documents linked to orders, and implement a new composite order
          type for making a deposit and a withdrawal from different accounts
          in a single operation.
    - title: Legalys Platform
      items:
        - Worked on the development of Corpus, a Django web application
          consisting of a multi-step form for Legalys's company registration
          service. I played a key role in the design and implementation of the
          database models, improving the integration with Stripe for payment
          processing, and implementing several features.
        - Re-implemented Orbis, Legalys's multi-step form for their Panama
          immigration processing service, which was originally made in Odoo, as
          a module in the Legalys Platform in order to provide a better user
          interface for their clients.
        - Contributed to the development of a new Know Your Customer (KYC)
          module, which allows clients to update their company information and
          upload documents for review by Legalys to comply with KYC
          regulations.
        - Implemented bidirectional data synchronization between Odoo and the
          Legalys Platform, allowing Legalys to review the submitted form data
          in Odoo, send data back to the platform, grant platform access by
          clicking a button, and keep the records and documents in Odoo, where
          they manage the rest of their business processes.
    - title: Megasoft Payment Gateway integration for Odoo
      items:
        - Participated in the implementation of a certified Odoo integration
          with Megasoft's payment processing platform, the most widely used in
          Venezuela. Venezuelan companies that use Odoo will be able to use the
          integration to receive credit card, mobile, and Zelle payments, while
          Bitmotto will receive a percentage of the amounts processed.
    - title: Modern Portals for Odoo
      items:
        - Built an Odoo module that provides a backend based on FastAPI with JWT
          authentication, as well as a separate Nuxt.js frontend, in less than
          two weeks. This will allow Bitmotto to quickly develop modern web
          frontends on top of Odoo for clients.
    - title: Bitmotto's own projects (Django Easystart, OTC, Remittance)
      items:
        - Expanded and refactored all unit tests, increasing test coverage to
          over 94% while reducing total test time to under 4 minutes.
