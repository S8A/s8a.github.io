    - title: Legalys Orbis
      items:
        - Re-implemented Legalys's form for their Panama immigration processing
          service, which was originally made in Odoo, as a web-app made in
          Django, in order to provide a better user interface for their clients.
        - Implemented an Odoo integration feature that allows administrators to
          click a button to upload the data of all completed forms to Odoo.
    - title: Perseus OTC
      items:
        - Developed most of a web-app for Perseus Ltd, a Panamanian currency
          exchange company, which allows them to keep track of the operations
          that they carry out, to check the balances of their accounts and their
          clients', and to view graphs of certain metrics.

        - Participated in the implementation of a certified Odoo integration
          with Megasoft's payment processing platform, the most widely used in
          Venezuela. Venezuelan companies that use Odoo will be able to use the
          integration to receive credit card, mobile and Zelle payments, while
          Bitmotto will receive a percentage of the amounts processed.

          click a button to upload the data of all registered companies to Odoo,
          allowing the company to migrate away from Zoho CRM and reduce
          subscription costs by over 60%.
