This new year, I want to start a regular blog series sharing links to articles, videos and any other content that I find interesting, insightful or just enjoyable, along with a brief summary and, in some cases, my thoughts regarding the content. I initially wanted to post weekly, but life happens, so I ended up deciding to post monthly instead.

Without further ado, here is my 1st "Links and thoughts" post, for January 2024, but compiled from December 25th last year until today, January 31st, in the rough chronological order in which I read/watched them.

- [The Baby Boom](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-baby-boom) &ndash; 2023-12-21 &ndash; _Aporia Magazine_ (Substack), article by Arctotherium
  - First, the author explains what actually caused the famous Baby Boom, i.e. the sudden rise in fertility of the wealthiest and most advanced countries in the world, beginning in the 1930s and roughly lasting until the 1960s. Contrary to other common explanations, the Baby Boom was caused by a marriage boom, which was the result of a rise in young men's socio-economic status relative to women, due to several factors.
  - Second, the author also explains what ended the Baby Boom: "second wave feminism", more concretely the cultural changes of the Sexual Revolution and the corresponding political, legal and economic changes which enabled it and artificially elevated young women's status to equal and in some cases surpass young men's. With traditional social institutions and taboos weakened, and Government Almighty serving as surrogate husband and tilting the playing field in education and work to favor women at the expense of men, marriage became less attractive to young women, and thus fertility collapsed.
  - Finally, the author presents a short list of policy proposals for reversing the fertility decline (the negative consequences and risks of fertility decline are mentioned at the beginning of the article):
    1. Roll back the welfare and pension state and lower income taxes.
    2. Roll back the regulatory state.
    3. End Affirmative Action for women.
    4. Defund education.
    5. Pronatalist monetary incentives should be targeted at married husbands, rather than mothers.
    6. Roll back the Sexual Revolution.
  - It seems to me that the explanations for the Baby Boom, the demographic trends preceding it, and the subsequent fertility collapse, are very solid, better than alternative explanations, and very well explained.
  - Regarding the policy proposals presented by the author, I think all of them are broadly consistent with my right-wing libertarian anarchist ethical-political philosophy, with some tweaks (no pro-natalist welfare checks, only tax breaks, for instance).

- [The Western European Marriage Pattern](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/the-western-european-marriage-pattern) &ndash; 2023-12-01 &ndash; _Not With a Bang_ (Substack) by Arctotherium
  - This article, by the same author of the previous one on this list, is about the definition, significance, and implications of the Western European Marriage Pattern (WEMP), which was a distinctive marriage pattern that developed in northwestern Europe in the 14th century after the Black Death. The WEMP is characterized by three features: absolute monogamy, almost no children born outside of marriage, and the delay of marriage until the couple is self-sufficient enough to form a new nuclear family household.
  - The author explains the following implications of the WEMP:
    - In pre-industrial Malthusian conditions, it resulted in a natural feedback loop which kept population levels roughly at the subsistence limit, due to fewer marriages in periods of poverty and more marriages in periods of plenty.
    - Genetically, it resulted in a class gradient for fertility which _selected_ for wealth-creating and wealth-maintaining traits, namely intelligence, productivity, trustworthiness, thrift, low time preference, and other such "bourgeois virtues". This fertility class gradient and higher mortality among the poor were the two mechanisms of the so-called "Clarkian selection" by which the medieval middle classes outbred the lower classes.
    - By making access to sex and family depend on personal economic success, it _incentivized_ men to acquire the aforementioned bourgeois virtues, as well as to make more high-risk, high-reward decisions like transoceanic trade and colonization.
    - By (almost) guaranteeing paternal certainty, it incentivized men to care about and work for the future, delaying gratification even beyond their own lifespan, i.e. to provide for their posterity and build a family legacy across generations.
    - These selection and incentive effects resulted in northwestern Europe developing unprecedented wide-scale wealth-producing impersonal social institutions, like strong capital markets and rule of law, which resulted in that region over-performing relative to what IQ only would predict, across many metrics: GDP per capita, high-end science, historical achievement, etc. Thus, the WEMP is, at least, a big contributor to historical northwestern European exceptionalism.
  - The author explains that a fourth distinctive feature of the WEMP, late and infrequent marriages, is actually just a by-product of the WEMP under poor economic conditions; under relatively favorable conditions, the WEMP produces higher frequency of marriages at younger ages, and thus fertility increases. Wrongly considering late and infrequent marriages as a defining feature of the WEMP leads many to misleadingly compare or even conflate the WEMP with the modern post-Sexual Revolution West. Instead, the author considers the modern status quo of late and infrequent marriages, the breakdown of absolute monogamy, and high rates of births outside marriage as more similar to primitive societies but with modern contraception.
  - I agree with the author's conclusion that the WEMP is no longer the norm in the modern world, and that its loss is a bad thing. The WEMP produced far better genetic selection effects and pro-civilizational behavior incentives than the status quo, as well as much higher fertility when combined with modern prosperity. The WEMP was fundamental to Western exceptionalism, and the modern dysgenic and anti-civilizational status quo is fundamental to Western decline.
