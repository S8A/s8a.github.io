This new year, I want to start a regular blog series sharing links to articles, videos and any other content that I find interesting, insightful or just enjoyable, along with a brief summary and, in some cases, my thoughts regarding the content. I initially wanted to post weekly, but life happens, so I ended up deciding to post monthly instead.

Without further ado, here is my 1st "Links and thoughts" post, for January 2024, but compiled from December 25th last year until today, January 31st, in the rough chronological order in which I read/watched them.


## _The Baby Boom_

First, the author explains what actually caused the famous Baby Boom, i.e. the sudden rise in fertility of the wealthiest and most advanced countries in the world, beginning in the 1930s and roughly lasting until the 1960s. Contrary to other common explanations, the Baby Boom was caused by a marriage boom, which was the result of a rise in young men's socio-economic status relative to women, due to several factors.

Second, the author also explains what ended the Baby Boom: "second wave feminism", more concretely the cultural changes of the Sexual Revolution and the corresponding political, legal and economic changes which enabled it and artificially elevated young women's status to equal and in some cases surpass young men's. With traditional social institutions and taboos weakened, and Government Almighty serving as surrogate husband and tilting the playing field in education and work to favor women at the expense of men, marriage became less attractive to young women, and thus fertility collapsed.

Finally, the author presents a short list of policy proposals for reversing the fertility decline (the negative consequences and risks of fertility decline are mentioned at the beginning of the article):
1. Roll back the welfare and pension state and lower income taxes.
2. Roll back the regulatory state.
3. End Affirmative Action for women.
4. Defund education.
5. Pronatalist monetary incentives should be targeted at married husbands, rather than mothers.
6. Roll back the Sexual Revolution.

It seems to me that the explanations for the Baby Boom, the demographic trends preceding it, and the subsequent fertility collapse, are very solid, better than alternative explanations, and very well explained.

Regarding the policy proposals presented by the author, I think all of them are broadly consistent with my right-wing libertarian anarchist ethical-political philosophy, with some tweaks (no pro-natalist welfare checks, only tax breaks, for instance).[^fn-1]


## _The Western European Marriage Pattern_

This article, by the same author of the previous one on this list, is about the definition, significance, and implications of the Western European Marriage Pattern (WEMP), which was a distinctive marriage pattern that developed in northwestern Europe in the 14th century after the Black Death. The WEMP is characterized by three features: absolute monogamy, almost no children born outside of marriage, and the delay of marriage until the couple is self-sufficient enough to form a new nuclear family household.

The author explains the following implications of the WEMP:
- In pre-industrial Malthusian conditions, it resulted in a natural feedback loop which kept population levels roughly at the subsistence limit, due to fewer marriages in periods of poverty and more marriages in periods of plenty.
- Genetically, it resulted in a class gradient for fertility which _selected_ for wealth-creating and wealth-maintaining traits, namely intelligence, productivity, trustworthiness, thrift, low time preference, and other such "bourgeois virtues". This fertility class gradient and higher mortality among the poor were the two mechanisms of the so-called "Clarkian selection"[^fn-2] by which the medieval middle classes outbred the lower classes.
- By making access to sex and family depend on personal economic success, it _incentivized_ men to acquire the aforementioned bourgeois virtues, as well as to make more high-risk, high-reward decisions like transoceanic trade and colonization.
- By (almost) guaranteeing paternal certainty, it incentivized men to care about and work for the future, delaying gratification even beyond their own lifespan, i.e. to provide for their posterity and build a family legacy across generations.
- These selection and incentive effects resulted in northwestern Europe developing unprecedented large-scale wealth-producing impersonal social institutions, like strong capital markets and rule of law, which resulted in that region over-performing relative to what IQ only would predict, across many metrics: GDP per capita, high-end science, historical achievement, etc. Thus, the WEMP is, at least, a big contributor to historical northwestern European exceptionalism.

The author explains that a fourth distinctive feature of the WEMP, late and infrequent marriages, is actually just a by-product of the WEMP under poor economic conditions. Under relatively favorable conditions, such as the early Industrial Revolution and the famous Baby Boom, the WEMP produces higher frequency of marriages at younger ages, and thus fertility increases. Erroneously considering late and infrequent marriages as a defining feature of the WEMP leads many to misleadingly compare or even conflate the WEMP with the modern post-Sexual Revolution West. Instead, the author considers the modern status quo of late and infrequent marriages, the breakdown of absolute monogamy, and high rates of births outside marriage as more similar to primitive societies but with modern contraception.

I agree with the author's conclusion that the WEMP is no longer the norm in the modern world, and that its loss is a bad thing. The WEMP produced far better genetic selection effects and pro-civilizational behavior incentives than the status quo, as well as much higher fertility when combined with modern prosperity. The WEMP was fundamental to Western exceptionalism, while the modern dysgenic and anti-civilizational status quo is fundamental to Western decline.


## _Aiming at something noble. Resolutions for human flourishing._

- [Linkt to article](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/aiming-at-something-noble-resolutions)
- Author: Henry Oliver
- Date: 2023-12-29

In this article, Oliver asserts that modern self-help literature is focused on things like productivity habits, stoicism, and meditation, which at best are only some means to our ends and at worst empty distractions, while neglecting to help us with what he thinks should be the main question of self-help: What should we do with our lives? How can we decide what our proper ends should be?

To answer such a complex and important question, Oliver says that we should look for guidance in deeper philosphical and religious authors, and in particular he recommends the work and philosophy of John Stuart Mill. Though mostly known for his defense of (classical) liberal causes and utilitarianism, Oliver says that Mill should be primarily considered a philosopher of human flourishing, and proceeds to summarize and explain Mill's thoughts regarding how to achieve it.

The core of Mill's thinking is that we all have an inner potential and a need to grow, and that we should aim to develop that potential and enable that growth, which is what he called "The Art of Life."

Mill thought that we must live by the following five principles in order to achieve human flourishing:
1. Character development (_Bildung_): The purpose of life is to improve ourselves in all senses; to develop ourselves across what he called the three "departments of life": morally, practically, and aesthetically.
2. Continuous discovery: To achieve character development, we must be able and willing to learn and try to understand the world by ourselves directly, instead of taking for granted what someone else says is the truth, continuously throughout our lives.
3. Many-sidedness (_Vielseitigkeit_): For continuous discovery to be effective, we must be able and willing to seriously consider different views, even ones that we disagree with, and synthetize them into our thinking as appropriate. Even plainly erroneous views might enrich us somehow.
4. Moral responsibility: We have an obligation to each other to improve ourselves, to be the best people we can be, because the improvement of individuals is necessary for the improvement of institutions and society itself, and that societal improvement benefits our individual development.
5. Nobleness: We must "aim at something noble," that is, we must focus on and strive for excellence and virtue, and that way we will achieve higher and higher levels of happiness, beyond what we could achieve by foolishly aiming for it as an end in itself. By cultivating such noble character, we will make decisions which provide the best outcomes for the most people, as individuals and as a society, without necessarily performing cold utilitarian calculations directly.

To conclude, Oliver exhorts us to make our New Year resolutions based on the five principles of human flourishing of John Stuart Mill, and provides some practical starting points like turning off Netflix and re-curating social media feeds, making lists of topics we want to learn about or opinions we hold but which we actually don't have solid knowledge about, attending events by political parties we disagree with, working on a side project, among others. In a few words, we must expand what we pay attention to, keep actively discovering and learning, and aim at something noble.

I personally liked the article and its general message. I agree that developing ourselves in all senses should be one of our main purposes in life, and that aiming at virtue and excellence allows us to achieve more happiness, for us and others, than vulgar hedonism. My only points of disagreement are with the notion of utilitarianism itself and the under-currents of universalist egalitarianism that taint Mill's thinking as well as Oliver's article, particularly in the assertions that paint "democracy" as some kind of noble project through which we improve ourselves as a society.[^fn-3] I won't elaborate more on this point for now, and it definitely doesn't invalidate the general wisdom of Mill's philosophy of human flourishing and the enjoyment of Oliver's writing.


## _Updating Böhm-Bawerk and Fixing Finance_

- [Linkt to podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH0xxe_aR6M)
- Host: Robert P. Murphy
- Guest: Peter Lewin
- Date: 2023-09-01

In this episode, Peter Lewin discusses his new book co-authored with Nicolás Cachanosky, _"Capital and Finance: Theory and History"_ [^fn-4-src-amazon-capital-and-finance], in which they unite Austrian capital theory with mainstream finance.

To start, Lewin summarizes the historial background of the main insight of the book. Pioneering Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk explained that increasing productivity and prosperity came about through ever more complex, more "roundabout" methods of production.

In trying to elaborate what he meant by "roundaboutness" concretely, Böhm-Bawerk came up with the "average period of production," essentially a physical measure of roundaboutness that reduced capital to "dated labor hours." The concept was rightfully criticized as theoretically inconsistent, it didn't take into account subjectivity and the heterogeneity of capital which Austrians emphasized, and came very close to a sort of labor theory of value.

Austrians wanted to express the evident notion that some production processes were longer, more complex, and more indirect than others, as this was fundamental to Austrian business cycle theory, but Böhm-Bawerk's concrete measure was inadequate. The inadequacy of the measure was considered by many mainstream economists in the 20th century to be a "final nail in the coffin" for Austrian economics.

Cachanosky's insight was that the concepts of roundaboutness and the interest rate sensitivity of roundabout methods of production essentially corresponded to the mainstream finance measures of Macaulay duration and modified duration of a fixed cash flow financial asset, such as a bond.[^fn-5-src-wikipedia-bond-duration]

The Macaulay duration[^fn-6-src-investopedia-macaulay-duration] is the weighted average maturity of cash flows, i.e. weighted average time until repayment, where the weight of each time period is the proportion of the asset's present value due to the corresponding cash flow. It's a time measure, usually expressed in years. Another way to interpret it is as the weighted average time that an investor must hold a bond so that the present value of the bond’s cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond.

The modified duration[^fn-7-src-investopedia-modified-duration] is a bit of a misnomer, as it actually measures the price sensitivity of the asset to interest rates, when treating the price as a function of yield. It's calculated by dividing the Macaulay duration by 1 plus the yield to maturity (total return) divided by the compounding frequency per year (the number of coupon periods per year for a bond).[^fn-8] It's technically not exactly the price elasticity of the asset, which would be the _percent_ change in price for a _percent_ change in yield. but rather a _semi-elasticity_, because it's the _percent_ change in price for a _unit_ change in yield.[^fn-9]

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: I'm not going to elaborate on my philosophy in this post, nor any post in the near future.
[^fn-2]: Here the author is referencing Gregory Clark's book, _A Farewell to Alms_, which he strongly recommends in the further reading section of the article and provides its JSTOR link: <https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7srwt>
[^fn-3]: If you read this part and immediately jumped to tiresome, non-sense conclusions of nefarious ideals, then first of all, you're wrong, and second, you lack either intelligence, reading, or the ability to think beyond platitudes and propaganda; the latter two can be cured, though, and you should start the process as soon as possible.
[^fn-4-src-amazon-capital-and-finance]: Amazon link for the _Capital and Finance_ book by Cachanosky and Lewin: <https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Finance-Routledge-International-Studies/dp/0367514559>
[^fn-5-src-wikipedia-bond-duration]: _Bond duration_. (2023-12-15). Wikipedia (permalink). <https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bond_duration&oldid=1190028577>
[^fn-6-src-investopedia-macaulay-duration]: Chen, J. (2022-09-29). _Macaulay duration_. Investopedia. <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macaulayduration.asp>
[^fn-7-src-investopedia-modified-duration]: Chen, J. (2022-02-12). _Modified duration_. Investopedia. <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modifiedduration.asp>
[^fn-8]: This is actually the formula derived for the particular case of periodically compounded yields (for fixed cash flow assets), which is how they're usually expressed in financial markets. The original formula of modified duration for continuosly compounded yields (for non-fixed cash flow assets) is the negative logarithmic derivative of the price of the asset, i.e. its present value, relative to yield. To use that formula one would need a function that defines the price as a function of yield.
[^fn-9]: Since yields are expressed as percentages, the unit change is 1 percentage point (1%). The fact that yields are percentages are precisely why it's more intuitive and useful to consider unit changes as opposed to percent changes. It's more natural to think about a 9% yield being reduced 1 percentage point to 8%, as opposed to thinking about the 9% yield being reduced 1% _of its current value_ i.e. by 0.09%.
