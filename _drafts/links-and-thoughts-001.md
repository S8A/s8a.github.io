This new year, I want to start a regular blog series sharing links to articles, videos and any other content that I find interesting, insightful or just enjoyable, along with a brief summary and, in some cases, my thoughts regarding the content. I initially wanted to post weekly, but life happens, so I ended up deciding to post monthly instead.

Without further ado, here is my 1st "Links and thoughts" post, for January 2024, but compiled from December 25th last year until today, January 31st, in the rough chronological order in which I read/watched them.


## _The Baby Boom_

- [Linkt to article](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-baby-boom)
- Author: Arctotherium
- Date: 2023-12-21

First, the author explains what actually caused the famous Baby Boom, i.e. the sudden rise in fertility of the wealthiest and most advanced countries in the world, beginning in the 1930s and roughly lasting until the 1960s. Contrary to other common explanations, the Baby Boom was caused by a marriage boom, which was the result of a rise in young men's socio-economic status relative to women, due to several factors.

Second, the author also explains what ended the Baby Boom: "second wave feminism", more concretely the cultural changes of the Sexual Revolution and the corresponding political, legal and economic changes which enabled it and artificially elevated young women's status to equal and in some cases surpass young men's. With traditional social institutions and taboos weakened, and Government Almighty serving as surrogate husband and tilting the playing field in education and work to favor women at the expense of men, marriage became less attractive to young women, and thus fertility collapsed.

Finally, the author presents a short list of policy proposals for reversing the fertility decline (the negative consequences and risks of fertility decline are mentioned at the beginning of the article):
1. Roll back the welfare and pension state and lower income taxes.
2. Roll back the regulatory state.
3. End Affirmative Action for women.
4. Defund education.
5. Pronatalist monetary incentives should be targeted at married husbands, rather than mothers.
6. Roll back the Sexual Revolution.

It seems to me that the explanations for the Baby Boom, the demographic trends preceding it, and the subsequent fertility collapse, are very solid, better than alternative explanations, and very well explained.

Regarding the policy proposals presented by the author, I think all of them are broadly consistent with my right-wing libertarian anarchist ethical-political philosophy, with some tweaks (no pro-natalist welfare checks, only tax breaks, for instance).[^fn-1]


## _The Western European Marriage Pattern_

- [Linkt to article](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/the-western-european-marriage-pattern)
- Author: Arctotherium

This article, by the same author of the previous one on this list, is about the definition, significance, and implications of the Western European Marriage Pattern (WEMP), which was a distinctive marriage pattern that developed in northwestern Europe in the 14th century after the Black Death. The WEMP is characterized by three features: absolute monogamy, almost no children born outside of marriage, and the delay of marriage until the couple is self-sufficient enough to form a new nuclear family household.

The author explains the following implications of the WEMP:
- In pre-industrial Malthusian conditions, it resulted in a natural feedback loop which kept population levels roughly at the subsistence limit, due to fewer marriages in periods of poverty and more marriages in periods of plenty.
- Genetically, it resulted in a class gradient for fertility which _selected_ for wealth-creating and wealth-maintaining traits, namely intelligence, productivity, trustworthiness, thrift, low time preference, and other such "bourgeois virtues". This fertility class gradient and higher mortality among the poor were the two mechanisms of the so-called "Clarkian selection"[^fn-2] by which the medieval middle classes outbred the lower classes.
- By making access to sex and family depend on personal economic success, it _incentivized_ men to acquire the aforementioned bourgeois virtues, as well as to make more high-risk, high-reward decisions like transoceanic trade and colonization.
- By (almost) guaranteeing paternal certainty, it incentivized men to care about and work for the future, delaying gratification even beyond their own lifespan, i.e. to provide for their posterity and build a family legacy across generations.
- These selection and incentive effects resulted in northwestern Europe developing unprecedented large-scale wealth-producing impersonal social institutions, like strong capital markets and rule of law, which resulted in that region over-performing relative to what IQ only would predict, across many metrics: GDP per capita, high-end science, historical achievement, etc. Thus, the WEMP is, at least, a big contributor to historical northwestern European exceptionalism.

The author explains that a fourth distinctive feature of the WEMP, late and infrequent marriages, is actually just a by-product of the WEMP under poor economic conditions. Under relatively favorable conditions, such as the early Industrial Revolution and the famous Baby Boom, the WEMP produces higher frequency of marriages at younger ages, and thus fertility increases. Erroneously considering late and infrequent marriages as a defining feature of the WEMP leads many to misleadingly compare or even conflate the WEMP with the modern post-Sexual Revolution West. Instead, the author considers the modern status quo of late and infrequent marriages, the breakdown of absolute monogamy, and high rates of births outside marriage as more similar to primitive societies but with modern contraception.

I agree with the author's conclusion that the WEMP is no longer the norm in the modern world, and that its loss is a bad thing. The WEMP produced far better genetic selection effects and pro-civilizational behavior incentives than the status quo, as well as much higher fertility when combined with modern prosperity. The WEMP was fundamental to Western exceptionalism, while the modern dysgenic and anti-civilizational status quo is fundamental to Western decline.


## _Aiming at something noble. Resolutions for human flourishing._

- [Linkt to article](https://www.commonreader.co.uk/p/aiming-at-something-noble-resolutions)
- Author: Henry Oliver
- Date: 2023-12-29
- Source: _The Common Reader_ (Substack)

In this article, Oliver asserts that modern self-help literature is focused on things like productivity habits, stoicism, and meditation, which at best are only some means to our ends and at worst empty distractions, while neglecting to help us with what he thinks should be the main question of self-help: What should we do with our lives? How can we decide what our proper ends should be?

To answer such a complex and important question, Oliver says that we should look for guidance in deeper philosphical and religious authors, and in particular he recommends the work and philosophy of John Stuart Mill. Though mostly known for his defense of (classical) liberal causes and utilitarianism, Oliver says that Mill should be primarily considered a philosopher of human flourishing, and proceeds to summarize and explain Mill's thoughts regarding how to achieve it.

The core of Mill's thinking is that we all have an inner potential and a need to grow, and that we should aim to develop that potential and enable that growth, which is what he called "The Art of Life."

Mill thought that we must live by the following five principles in order to achieve human flourishing:
1. Character development (_Bildung_): The purpose of life is to improve ourselves in all senses; to develop ourselves across what he called the three "departments of life": morally, practically, and aesthetically.
2. Continuous discovery: To achieve character development, we must be able and willing to learn and try to understand the world by ourselves directly, instead of taking for granted what someone else says is the truth, continuously throughout our lives.
3. Many-sidedness (_Vielseitigkeit_): For continuous discovery to be effective, we must be able and willing to seriously consider different views, even ones that we disagree with, and synthetize them into our thinking as appropriate. Even plainly erroneous views might enrich us somehow.
4. Moral responsibility: We have an obligation to each other to improve ourselves, to be the best people we can be, because the improvement of individuals is necessary for the improvement of institutions and society itself, and that societal improvement benefits our individual development.
5. Nobleness: We must "aim at something noble," that is, we must focus on and strive for excellence and virtue, and that way we will achieve higher and higher levels of happiness, beyond what we could achieve by foolishly aiming for it as an end in itself. By cultivating such noble character, we will make decisions which provide the best outcomes for the most people, as individuals and as a society, without necessarily performing cold utilitarian calculations directly.

To conclude, Oliver exhorts us to make our New Year resolutions based on the five principles of human flourishing of John Stuart Mill, and provides some practical starting points like turning off Netflix and re-curating social media feeds, making lists of topics we want to learn about or opinions we hold but which we actually don't have solid knowledge about, attending events by political parties we disagree with, working on a side project, among others. In a few words, we must expand what we pay attention to, keep actively discovering and learning, and aim at something noble.

I personally liked the article and its general message. I agree that developing ourselves in all senses should be one of our main purposes in life, and that aiming at virtue and excellence allows us to achieve more happiness, for us and others, than vulgar hedonism. My only points of disagreement are with the notion of utilitarianism itself and the under-currents of universalist egalitarianism that taint Mill's thinking as well as Oliver's article, particularly in the assertions that paint "democracy" as some kind of noble project through which we improve ourselves as a society.[^fn-3] I won't elaborate more on this point for now, and it definitely doesn't invalidate the general wisdom of Mill's philosophy of human flourishing and the enjoyment of Oliver's writing.


## _Updating Böhm-Bawerk and Fixing Finance_

- [Linkt to podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH0xxe_aR6M)
- Host: Robert P. Murphy
- Guest: Peter Lewin
- Date: 2023-09-01
- Source: _The Human Action Podcast_ (YouTube)

In this episode, Peter Lewin discusses his new book co-authored with Nicolás Cachanosky, _"Capital and Finance: Theory and History"_ [^fn-4-src-amazon-capital-and-finance], in which they unite Austrian capital theory with mainstream finance.

To start, Lewin summarizes the historial background of the main insight of the book. Pioneering Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk explained that increasing productivity and prosperity came about through ever more complex, more "roundabout" methods of production.

In trying to elaborate what he meant by "roundaboutness" concretely, Böhm-Bawerk came up with the "average period of production," essentially a physical measure of roundaboutness that reduced capital to "dated labor hours." The concept was rightfully criticized as theoretically inconsistent, it didn't take into account subjectivity and the heterogeneity of capital which Austrians emphasized, and came very close to a sort of labor theory of value.

Austrians wanted to express the evident notion that some production processes were longer, more complex, and more indirect than others, as this was fundamental to Austrian business cycle theory, but Böhm-Bawerk's concrete measure was inadequate. The inadequacy of the measure was considered by many mainstream economists in the 20th century to be a "final nail in the coffin" for Austrian economics.

Cachanosky's insight was that the concepts of roundaboutness and the interest rate sensitivity of roundabout methods of production essentially corresponded to generalizations of the mainstream finance measures of Macaulay duration and modified duration of a fixed cash flow financial asset, such as a bond.[^fn-5-src-wikipedia-bond-duration]

The Macaulay duration[^fn-6-src-investopedia-macaulay-duration] is the weighted average maturity of cash flows, i.e. weighted average time until repayment, where the weight of each time period is the proportion of the asset's present value due to the corresponding cash flow. It's a time measure, usually expressed in years. Another way to interpret it is as the weighted average time that an investor must hold a bond so that the present value of the bond’s cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond.

The modified duration[^fn-7-src-investopedia-modified-duration] is a bit of a misnomer, as it actually measures the price sensitivity of the asset to interest rates, when treating the price as a function of yield. It's calculated by dividing the Macaulay duration by 1 plus the yield to maturity[^fn-8-src-wikipedia-yield-to-maturity] (the discount rate at which the present value of the asset would equal its current price) divided by the compounding frequency per year (the number of coupon periods per year for a bond).[^fn-9] It's technically not exactly the price elasticity of the asset, which would be the _percent_ change in price for a _percent_ change in yield. but rather a _semi-elasticity_, because it's the _percent_ change in price for a _unit_ change in yield.[^fn-10]

The key is to extend the application of these two measures beyond fixed cash flow financial assets, generalizing them for the present value of the business project. The entrepreneur must make a concrete business plan, for which he has to make a reasonable forecast of the flow of revenues and expenditures his prospective business project will accrue at each time period through a definite time horizon in the future. Using these expected cash flows and setting the discount rate taking into account his time preference and market interest rates, the entrepreneur can calculate the estimated monetary present value of his investment in the business project, just like he could do with an investment in a fixed cash flow asset.

In the same manner, the entrepreneur can calculate the Macaulay duration of his investment as the weighted average of the time periods of his business project weighed by the proportion of the project's present value that is due in each period. This would represent the weighted average time until the project's cash flows are received or, alternatively, the average time the entrepreneur would have to wait so that the received cash flows equal the present value of the project. Cachanosky realized that the Macaulay duration of a business project investment is essentially a measure of roundaboutness, i.e. the average period of production of that project, with weights based on the monetary value of its estimated future cash flows as appraised by the entrepreneur himself.

Using the Macaulay duration as the average period of production overcomes all the shortcomings of Böhm-Bawerk's proposed solution. By using monetary value weights it coherently accounts for the heterogeneity of capital. Since the weights are based on the entrepreneur's estimates of future cash flows it accounts for the subjective nature of value and the uncertainty of the future. It's based on a forward-looking judgment as opposed to backward-looking after-the-fact data.

After calculating the Macaulay duration of the business project, the entrepreneur can use it to calculate its modified duration, by dividing it by 1 plus the discount rate established by the entrepreneur[^fn-11] divided by the number of cash flow time periods per year. This measurement would represent the price semi-elasticity of the project, that is, the sensitivity of the project's valuation to changes in interest rates. Cachanosky realized that this is essentially a measure of the interest rate sensitivity of the business project, that corresponds perfectly with what Austrian business cycle predicts: more roundabout projects, that is, projects with longer average periods of production (as measured by Macaulay duration), are more sensitive to changes in interest rates (modified duration is higher).

As Lewin explains, though some Austrian economists came close (such as Ludwig Lachmann), none had reached the complete realization that Macaulay duration corresponded to average period of production and modified duration corresponded to interest rate sensitivity when it comes to business projects. Had someone done so earlier, he reflects, Austrians could have saved themselves a lot of trouble and maybe the whole Cambridge capital controversy[^fn-12-src-wikipedia-cambridge-capital-controversy] could have been avoided.

To wrap up, Lewin briefly explains the concept of economic value added (EVA), which is also an important theme in the book. EVA is a financial performance measure that attempts to estimate the economic profit of a firm, or the value created in excess of the required return of the firm's shareholders. The formula for calculating EVA is the net operating profit after taxes (with adjustments) minus the capital charge, that is, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC, which has its own formula) times the capital employed (total assets minus current liabilities).[^fn-13-src-wikipedia-economic-value-added] Lewin doesn't show or explain the actual formula, but he tries to explain in general the significance of the measure as an estimate of the true economic profit of a business, and he explains that in the book they do such things as calculating Macaulay duration and modified duration using EVA instead of present value.

Overall, I think this was a great episode. I enjoyed the discussion a lot, the insights and their significance were well explained, and certainly I would read the book if I had a copy. What really helped me thoroughly understand the insights, though, was writing this whole  section, researching the concepts and formulas and thinking through how it's all tied together.


## _Critical Comments on Anarcho-Capitalism_

- [Linkt to article](https://betonit.substack.com/p/critical-comments-on-anarcho-capitalism)
- Author: Rodrigo Coelho (guest post)
- Date: 2023-12-13
- Source: _Bet On It_ (Substack)

This is a guest post on libertarian economist Bryan Caplan's Substack by a Portuguese reader called Rodrigo Coelho. The post consists of critical comments by Coelho in response to Caplan's debate defending anarcho-capitalism versus Yaron Brook's minarchism.[^fn-14-src-youtube-brook-caplan-soho-debate]

To start, Coelho claims to be well-read in anarcho-capitalist theory, from Caplan's own writings[^fn-15-src-caplan-anarchism-cheatsheet-pdf] to classic authors like David Friedman, Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Gustave de Molinari, and Lysander Spooner. It certainly seems to me that he has done his reading.

Coelho's main objection is against the common argument by Caplan (which I also have used) that private security guards, gated communities, and private commercial arbitration firms already exist, outnumber government provision of those services, and usually provide much better service. However, Coelho points out, those industries exist _within_ a government legal framework, and it's not clear to him that they would work that well absent that, in an anarchic polycentric legal order.

Furthermore, Coelho says, virtually all examples of near laissez-faire success stories are examples of (near) minarchism, that is, societies in which government existed and provided robuts rule of law to undergird their relatively laissez-faire economies. Namely: late 19th century Great Britain and United States of America, and modern Switzerland, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

On the other hand, examples as (near) anarcho-capitalism, such as medieval Iceland and Ireland, though he admits to not be as well-read on them, seem rather underwhelming. Sure, they prove that the Hobbesian myth of war-of-all-against-all is wrong, that state-less societies with a polycentric legal order are perfectly possible, but they didn't have anything like the Industrial Revolution, they fell short of the material prosperity of other pre-industrial societies like Ancient Greece or Rennaisance Italy, and they probably weren't beacons of individual rights as classical liberals and libertarians would want.

Coelho even concedes that if the experiment was repeated today it would also probably _work_ in the sense of there not being open warfare on the streets, but he's skeptical that whatever compromise the security firms come up with would be better in practical terms than a modern state-provided rule of law with laissez-faire economic policy.

**My response to this main objection:** I agree that, as David Friedman says and Coelho quotes, an anarcho-capitalist polycentric legal order _might_ be far from classical liberal standards of right-protection. I think it would vary depending on the particular people and circumstances of time and place in which it's applied, and how exactly the transition is effected. However, I think the apparent mediocrity of early medieval state-less societies is not a good indicator how things would work in modern Western industrial societies if they became state-less.

Culture matters, and culture is downsteam from biology, and thus it's not surprising that different populations are more or less likely than others to even conceive of privatizing everything according to libertarian natural-law legal theory, abolishing the state, and creating industries for providing dispute resolution, security, and the like, and they would have different levels of success supposing they tried. Also, of course, is the problem of the means, strategy and incentives for actually overthrowing the state in each case, considering rulers' entrenched interests, the armies and equipment at their disposal, etc. To be clear, I don't think it's likely to happen anywhere in the near future and at significant scales, the costs are just too great and not enough people are sold on the idea.

But I am convinced that _if_ enough people in a certain location had the disposition and the means for effecting such regime change appropriately, and the population under the former state's jurisdiction had the IQ and culture appropriate for it, an anarcho-capitalistic polycentric legal order would work without issue, and it would soon become very prosperous, possibly a lot more prosperous than any past or existing regime. In any case, it would be the right thing to do _ethically_, which is the main (only?) concern for a deontological political-ethical philosophy.

Another point I want to bring up with this is that Coelho reflects that there must have been something unique about the British and American political tradition (when it comes to rule of law and protection of private property) which took centuries to develop and was crucial for the Industrial Revolution and the unprecedented rise of freedom and prosperity in the 19th century.

I think that's true, and it's basically the culmination of northwestern European exceptionalism, which was simply people from that particular area having relatively high levels of IQ and bourgeois virtues, due to the incentives and selection effects produced by their marriage pattern, general culture and environment, and which lead them to develop unprecedented large-scale impersonal wealth-creating social institutions, such as robust private property protections and capital markets.[^fn-15]

Due to particular events and circumstances, it happened within a framework of regional state monopolization of ultimate decision-making, it's true, but I think it's very reasonable to conceive that the same people in the same historial era would have thrived and developed such institutions and levels of wealth and achievement in a polycentric legal order. Also, let's not forget it came about in the context of centuries of high fragmentation and thus interjurisdictional competition in Europe, as Ralph Raico explained in his article on the so-called European miracle.[^fn-17-src-mises-raico-european-miracle]

With this I'm not trying to contradict that it took centuries to develop, I'm just saying that Anglo liberalism has much older historical roots in the decentralized proto-liberal regimes of the Dutch Republic and the Swiss Confederation, and the fact that the Industrial Revolution started when and where it did shouldn't make us conclude that it was necessarily due to the state-based legal order _per se_, but rather due to the exceptional traits of the people and thus the institutions of northwestern Europe, and precisely _because of those things_ their states were relatively benign and laissez-faire. **Back to Coelho's objections.**

After his main objection, Coelho briefly puts forward another one that he considers more obvious, which is basically the following: if the free market (which would be _truly_ free in such a natural state-less situation) leads to efficient provision of so-called "government" services, then how come states came about in the first place?

**My response to his second objection:** I'm not sure if this objection is actually more solid than the previous one or less solid, but it's certainly more of a straightforward "gotcha." My response is basically the counter-argument Caplan himself presented for a more economically sophisticated version of the same objection in a short Econlib blog post.[^fn-18-src-econlib-caplan-ancap-statist-lockin]

Basically, the argument is that a way in which anarcho-capitalism might fail is if economies of scale in "government" services are so great compared to demand that there is only room for, say, three companies in a large geographical area, which would make it very easy for them to collude into a monopoly provider, after which becoming a state would only be a small step. Anarcho-capitalists give the counter-argument that such is not the case, based on the performance of present-day police, for example, we know that state-sized providers are far above optimum size, so economies of scale are not actually so great relative to -market demand that a downward spiral of consolidation would occur.

But here's the gotcha (mirroring Coelho's): if economies of scale for "government" services are really so weak, why did states emerge and remained stable for hundreds of years? Boom, Ancapistan-in-your-head disproved by actually looking around or reading a history book! Not so fast. As Caplan explains, it's very plausible that thousands or hundreds of years ago, demand for "government" services _was_ very small relative to economies of scale pretty much everywhere (you know, worldwide pre-industrial poverty) and thus predictably states emerged. As economic growth progressed, the "government" services market grew, making room for many more competing firms in any given area. However, already existing states have used their power to prevent new entrants. Thus, we have a situation of lock-in by true (regional) monopoly providers who had a first-mover advantage and have successfully used violence to protect their position.

This seems pretty much correct to me, but I'd also add that historical and current states haven't exactly come about through consolidation of legitimate non-coercive providers of security, dispute-resolution, etc. In fact, most states, and certainly all existing states, trace their origins to stationary bandits and conquering armies, that is, they were coercive and thus illegitimate from the beginning. In my opinion, Caplan's explanation of economies of scale versus extent of market demand serves more to explain why/how states became and stayed stable in their relative monopoly position, and partly explains why the originally subjugated populations usually found it best to accept their rulers; there just wasn't enough room for more competition. But it's important to emphasize that states have been created from and through unjustified violent subjugation of populations, both for the ethical importance of this fact as well as reminding us that analyzing them as one would a market of private providers and voluntary transactions is not adequate. They're distortions by their very nature. **Back to Coelho's objections.**

Coelho's last two objections are about two admittedly thorny topics that he considers that no anarcho-capitalist author has addressed convincingly: children and nukes.[^fn-19]

Regarding children, Coelho's concern is simple and understandable: what happens when a child abuser has a kid? Pointing out the flaws of the status quo is not enough, we need something more solid. He adds to his concern that presumably children wouldn't be customers of any rights-protection agency.

**My response to this third objection:** I agree that libertarian legal theorists have not published as much regarding this topic, I suspect in part due to fear that their quotes are going to be taken out of context, even if their view of what anarcho-capitalism would look like regarding children doesn't differ that much from the protections they already enjoy.

It doesn't help that some respected libertarian scholars have taken the radical position that parents have no positive obligations for caring for their children, i.e. that they can let them die of starvation or illness (though not agress upon them, of course); the most notable example being  Murray Rothbard himself, who is usually good, in his foundational book _The Ethics of Liberty_.[^fn-20-src-rothbard-the-ethics-of-liberty]

I'll elaborate on my position to illustrate how I think an anarcho-capitalist society could work in this regard, and I think and hope that most serious libertarian legal theorists and nearly all layman libertarians would broadly agree with me.

To start, parents have some basic positive obligations for providing shelter, food and care for their dependent biological children, due to the fact that they are directly responsible for bringing them to a state of natural dependency and vulnerability through their actions (namely, procreation leading to conception). Rothbard's objections that one cannot deduce from basic libertarian axioms the standard of living that parents are obligated to provide or that it varies by economic conditions are moot. Proper libertarian legal theory comes from natural law theory, and it's evident that the _rightful_ natural order of things is that parents provide for the survival of their children. So, at least the bare minimum for the continued survival of the child is logically deducible, and what that bare minimum requires is pretty much intersubjectively ascertainable through logic and knowledge of biology.

In any case, within the barebones libertarian legal framework, it's to be expected and totally consistent that arbitration firms could fill in that blank, so to speak, according to tradition, custom, and/or economic conditions, such that parents would be obligated to provide more than the bare minimum, though not an arbitrarily high standard of living.

Of course, if the parents can't or don't want to raise and provide for their children, they can (and must, in case of inability to provide) give away their guardianship of the children to another adult or couple of adults who are able and willing to fulfill those obligations, even in exchange for some property. Now, let's clarify that parents don't _own their children_ like property (i.e. absolute exclusive control), since they're human beings and thus self-owners (with the implied obligation upon others of non-aggression), though they're not fully developed rational moral-legal agents and thus they can't exercise their freedum fully. Thus, parents own their _guardianship_ over their children, which consists of a bundle of exclusive but non-absolute rights (parental authority) and obligations (care and provision for the needs of the child) derived from the inability of the children of exercising the full faculties of a fully developed rational moral-legal agent.

As the child learns and develops through their teens, his faculties and thus his scope for free agency gradually increases, until he becomes an adult. The exact age at which a minor becomes an adult is thus determined by his individual faculties and thus varies from case to case, but importantly the variance has obvious biological limits in practice (e.g. there are no 10 year old adults) and the average age is more or less around the current legal demarcation in most Western regimes (around 18 years old). It's not unreasonable to think that the vast majority of arbitration providers would keep defining something close to 18 years old as the minimum age at which a person is considered an adult with full agency _until proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt_, and anything under that as not an adult with full agency _unless proven otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt_.[^fn-21]

Now, back to the topic of giving away guardianship. Here is where understandable concerns about possible moral hazards come in, e.g. rich child abusers buying kids from deadbeat parents. To this I'd say that parents, while they still have guardianship, obviously have the duty to exercise due dilligence in selecting who they give away their guardianship rights to, and thus would be liable for negligence or even complicity, depending on the case, if their children's new guardians abuse them and the parents could've reasonably foreseen that.

Who would bring forth abusers to justice in an anarcho-capitalist private law society? There are many possibilities. The most robust option would be a covenant community which, for example, set forth explicit contractual conditions with monetary penalties for child neglect or abuse, and/or provision of funds for a private firm contracted out for child protection. Of course such a community would select against child abusers in the first place, which leaves us with the cases of communities without these contractual protections and (hypothetically) communities of organized abusers. For the former case, as I said before, I think minimum positive obligations are consistent with libertarian legal theory and thus any third party, such as a family member or simply a concerned neighbor, could sue the abusive parents or guardians in the name of the victimized children, or straight up rescue them themselves or hire a firm to do so, as long as the hero third party is sure enough that abuse is happening and they can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt should the guardians survive and counter sue.

Regarding hypothetical communities organized for abuse, I think it's obviously very unrealistic, first of all, and in any case the same logic regarding third party voluntary heroism applies, just that the prospective heroes then must be people from outside the community. I think if a bunch of child abusers organized to form a new community for their nefarious deeds, good people would notice and would rightfully attack them or hire private firms to attack them. I can easily imagine a fundraiser for that getting more than enough money.

This all comes back to something that should be obvious: the first and most important bulwark against child abuse is there being a broad cultural agreement that child abuse is abhorrent and even criminal, enough willingness and means to apply the necessary consequences on the abusers, and alertness to find out if and when it's occurring. Such is the case with a state or not, so any objection to the effect of "well your system relies on someone finding out, bringing the abusers to court and proving the case, or exerting violence themselves" is irrelevant. Under the status quo, someone has to find out, prove the abuse to the relevant institutions, or exert violence directly. It's just that we have a particular organization (the state) ostensibly in charge of doing all that, but there is no magic in delegating a task to a criminal monopolizer of ultimate decision-making, and plenty of deficiencies in its actual operation, as well as perverse incentives of surveillance and indoctrination. I hope my rough sketch convincingly illustrated how things could work in a private law society, though I admit a more thorough and scholarly work by a libertarian big name would be nice. **Back to Coelho's objections.**

[^fn-9]: This is actually the formula derived for the particular case of periodically compounded yields (for fixed cash flow assets), which is how they're usually expressed in financial markets. The original formula of modified duration for continuosly compounded yields (for non-fixed cash flow assets) is the negative logarithmic derivative of the price of the asset, i.e. its present value, relative to yield. To use that formula one would need a function that defines the price as a function of yield.
[^fn-10]: Since yields are expressed as percentages, the unit change is 1 percentage point (1%). The fact that yields are percentages are precisely why it's more intuitive and useful to consider unit changes as opposed to percent changes. It's more natural to think about a 9% yield being reduced 1 percentage point to 8%, as opposed to thinking about the 9% yield being reduced 1% _of its current value_ i.e. by 0.09%.
[^fn-11]: As mentioned before, the yield to maturity of a fixed cash flow asset is defined as its theoretical internal rate of return, that is, the discount rate at which the asset's present value would equal its current price. For the purposes of the entrepreneur's prospective appraisal, the "market price" of his business project is assumed to equal its estimated present value, that is, he assumes that his investment is not overvalued or undervalued relative to its actual returns. Therefore, the discount rate the entrepreneur set, based on his time preference and market interest rates, for calculating the business project's present value is assumed to be the discount rate at which the investment's present value equals its price, i.e. the internal rate of return, which is then used as the "yield to maturity" in the modified duration formula.

[^fn-15-src-caplan-anarchism-cheatsheet-pdf]: I particularly like the PDF "cheatsheet" that Caplan uploaded to his GMU page, in which he summarizes the main arguments for government and against anarcho-capitalism, along with his counter-arguments for each of them. It's a good overview for a smart layman who wants an introduction to the arguments, as well as a good resource for anarcho-capitalists who have done their reading already and just want to remember if they're forgetting something while arguing with someone, for example.

[^fn-21]: This seems to me a pretty reasonable rule, with a stringent standard for evidence such that children would be properly protected from being erroneously considered legal adults, and adults would be protected from being erroneously considered children or mentally incapable of exercising agency. The injustice of the edge case of a, for example, 16 year old wise beyond his years being considered a minor still is that, an edge case, as well as a relatively mild injustice which would only last 2 more years anyway. On the other hand, there are zero 12 year old mentally adults, for example, which should be obvious if you were ever a 12 year old and think about it for 30 seconds, so there should be no reason to fear any case of one being legally considered adult by a court. Finally, any person over 18 years old who's really _so_ mentally stunted that he shouldn't be allowed to be considered an adult with full mental faculties is easily identifiable through observation and interaction, so there should be no problem proving it to a court.
