This month I was busy, so I didn't have tome to read as many great articles as the previous month and to write at length about them.

Anyway, here's what I could gather for the 2nd post in my "Links and thoughts" series, for February 2024.

## _Why Do Programmers Listen to Music?_

As Rosenbauer explains, a superficial answer to the question of why do programmers (and office workers in general) listen to music while working could simply be because it increases focus and productivity, but that answer just raises the question of _why_. I'd also add that such an answer assumes that it increases focus and productivity, but it could be the case that it actually doesn't have any effect either way or that it even decreases it slightly.

Rosenbauer proposes a deeper, alternative explanation: the human brain wants highly multisensory experiences. As he explains, primitive hunter-gatherers had to be able to pay attention to multiple simultaneous real-time sensory inputs, process them, and quickly react appropriately to the information in order to hunt effectively, evade predators, and generally survive in nature. Thus, this selective pressure resulted in the human brain evolving to be able to process multiple sensory data streams simultaneously, and even to feel unease when a sensory input is missing, as that could indicate trouble or vulnerability.

Programming, and office work in general, is an overwhelmingly visual activity, with the only auditory and tactile feedback being the sound and feel of typing on the keyboard, and maybe moving the mouse, scrolling, and clicking. Our brain feels unease because of the lack of sensory inputs, and thus we feel compelled to listen to music while working. However, as Rosenbauer explains, since the music has nothing to do with the actual task, the implication is that what we're doing is the equivalent of feeding our brain sensory junk food.

Next, he presents the idea of sensory substitution. Since the brain cortex is composed of modular, repeating circuits called cortical columns that are nearly interchangeable, it's possible to change the sensory modality of a brain region just by changing its inputs. Going further, it's theoretically possible to feed in data one has no natural sense for, in other words, sensory augmentation.

For the rest of the article, Rosenbauer speculates about the features that a code sonification scheme should have in order to actually provide useful auditory information that increases effective use of brain power and thus programming productivity. A simple text-to-speech program would probably be counterproductive, since it's just an inferior way of reading code. 

A code sonification scheme that actually reduces programmer effort should probably focus on the structure that otherwise would have to be inferred manually. A rough, "zoomed-out" representation of large amounts of code in audio form could be a good starting point. A full-fledged implementation could play notes as one scrolls through the code editor, in a way that indicates how each part relates to the rest of the code on a larger scale.

Finally, Rosenbauer briefly expresses interest in somehow integrating a haptic feedback device to augment the programming experience.

I thoroughly agreed with Rosenbauer's evolutionary explanation for why we listen to music while programming, and found his ideas for code sonification interesting and worth investigating. Meanwhile, I'll keep listening to metal while programming.
