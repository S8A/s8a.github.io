## _Why Open Borders Don't Work for Small Countries_

In this article, McMaken presents counter-arguments to consequentialist arguments for open borders, or, as he says, the lack of arguments for the cases he presents. The "open borders" position is that there should be zero legal restrictions at all on immigration,  or near zero restrictions, with the common exception being the denial of entry to known criminals.

McMaken argues that consequentialist arguments for open borders are overwhelmingly focused on the case of immigration of people from lower-income countries to higher-income, developed countries, while other cases are often not acknowledged at all, or dismissed as uncommon, or otherwise implicitly treated as if there are no tradeoffs or special considerations.

In the article, McMaken presents several hypothetical cases along with corresponding real-world examples that illustrate how an open borders policy could be detrimental, or even catastrophic, for the population of the country applying it. The general argument is that if enough people of a different ethnic group or political persuasion than the host country immigrate there, the immigrants could influence the host country's policies in a direction that jeopardizes the rights of the original inhabitants, perhaps catastrophically. A common case is the one alluded to by the title of the article: small countries neighboring larger populations of a different and possibly hostile country.

I highly recommend reading the article, it's very well redacted and the author's argument is clear and convincing. It's true that open borders advocates tend to focus on the familiar case of economic immigration to developed countries while ignoring or dismissing more complex cases and possible perils in the political reality of implementing open borders.

I think I should briefly discuss some important points regarding this topic. For deontological libertarians, such as myself, the primary or even sole criterion in the immigration debate is adherence to principle; in other words, what does libertarian legal theory imply in this matter. Most libertarians who advocate for open borders do so on deontological grounds, and they're often quick to dismiss these consequentialist considerations as secondary, irrelevant, or even non-existant. My position is that they're mostly wrong even on deontological grounds; the implications of libertarian legal theory on this matter are more nuanced. However, I won't elaborate on my position for now.
