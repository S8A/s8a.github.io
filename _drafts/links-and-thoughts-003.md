For this month's post, I want to do something different. This time, instead of presenting articles in the rough chronological order in which I read them, I'm going to group them by their general topic or themes. I have chosen to do this because some groups of articles have more or less _opposing_ views on a subject, and I will contrast them and give _my_ opinion on the matter.

## Immigration

### _Why Open Borders Don't Work for Small Countries_

- [Link to article](https://mises.org/mises-wire/why-open-borders-dont-work-small-countries)
- Author: Ryan McMaken
- Date: 2024-01-09

In this article, McMaken presents counter-arguments to consequentialist arguments for open borders, or, as he says, the lack of arguments for the cases he presents. The "open borders" position is that there should be zero legal restrictions at all on immigration,  or near zero restrictions, with the common exception being the denial of entry to known criminals.

McMaken argues that consequentialist arguments for open borders are overwhelmingly focused on the case of immigration of people from lower-income countries to higher-income, developed countries, and that those argumenta usually focus on the effects of such immigration on domestic economic factors like productivity and GDP per capita. Meanwhile, different cases of immigration are often not considered at all, and other factors are assumed to remain the same, not acknowledged at all, or dismissed as irrelevant.

In the article, McMaken presents several hypothetical cases along with corresponding real-world examples to elaborate how, in cases of demographic asymmetries between bordering countries of different sizes, an open borders policy could be detrimental to the host population of the smaller country. The general argument is that if enough people of a different ethnic group or political persuasion than the host country immigrate there, the immigrants could influence the host country's policies in a direction that jeopardizes the rights of the original inhabitants, perhaps catastrophically. A common case is the one alluded to by the title of the article: small countries neighboring larger populations of a different and possibly hostile country.

I highly recommend reading the article, it's very well redacted and the author's argument is clear and convincing. It's true that open borders advocates tend to focus on the familiar case of economic immigration to developed countries while ignoring or dismissing more complex cases and possible perils in the political reality of implementing open borders.

I will now briefly discuss some important points regarding this topic. For deontological libertarians, such as myself, the primary or even sole criterion in the immigration debate is adherence to principle; in other words, what does libertarian legal theory imply in this matter. Most libertarians who advocate for open borders do so on deontological grounds, and they're often quick to dismiss these consequentialist considerations and tradeoffs as secondary, irrelevant, or even non-existent.[^fn-1] My position is that they're mostly wrong even on deontological grounds; the implications of libertarian legal theory on this matter are more nuanced. However, I won't elaborate on my position yet; I'll do that on the next section which presents a contrasting article.


### _Immigration in an Nth-Best World_

- Author: Sheldon Richman (guest post)

This is a guest post on libertarian economist Bryan Caplan's Substack by Sheldon Richman, a notable libertarian scholar and friend of Caplan. In this article, Richman responds to recent arguments made by certain libertarians trying to justify government restrictions on immigration or even "closed borders."[^fn-2]

As Richman explains, we're in an "Nth-best" world, neither fully libertarian nor fully totalitarian; most of the world's countries have mixed economies which combines markets with more or less government intervention of different kinds. If libertarians want to be relevant in our Nth-best real world, we must be able to articulate Nth-best policy alternatives to deal with often nuanced and thorny real-world problems, beyond just parroting the pure libertarian ideal _ad nauseam_; this however, doesn't mean that we must abandon principles.

Richman argues that libertarians who justify government restrictions on immigration try to present their position as the realistic Nth-best policy, but that they're wrong for abandoning basic libertarian principles. In particular, he attacks two of the most common arguments made by libertarians for immigration restrictions, which I'll call the "natives collectively own government property" argument and the "immigrants are a tax burden" argument.

The "natives collectively own government property" argument, as Richman summarizes it, is that "we the people" are the true or rightful owners of government-controlled property, therefore "we" have the right to set rules for entry and use (presumably decided through voting), and therefore "we" could exclude non-owners (foreigners) or even that "we" _should_ exclude them for various reasons. Richman concedes that the opposite position, that government should set zero rules on "public" property, is a naive, illogical position that is not required by principle and is most often advocated by new "social-media" libertarians. However, he also correctly explains that it's not tenable that the government could set _any_ rule whatsoever on "public" property, because it would effectively mean that virtually any kind of tyrannical requirements could be imposed, which is obviously incompatible with libertarian principles. Furthermore, even if "we the people" decided the rules through voting it would still be un-libertarian, since there is no such thing as a "general will of The People"[^fn-3] and in any voting system there would be a portion of the voters who would be against the chosen rules.

Richmand doesn't actually elaborate the "immigrants are a tax burden" argument, he just briefly mentions it and refutes it by appealing to the arguments on Caplan's book advocating for open borders and to the data examined by the Cato Institute. I'll briefly summarize what the general argument is supposed to be: some/most/all immigrants are or would be net tax consumers, that is, they consume more in government services or expenditures (particularly welfare) than they contribute in taxes, therefore more immigration would result in an increased tax burden on the native population or perhaps even a fiscal disaster (particularly under an open borders policy). Richman replies, echoing Caplan, that the data doesn't back that fear, that even under open borders the burdensome immigrant would be the exception rather than the rule, and that in any case that would not justify restricting the principle of free immigration, just as the principle of free reproduction should be ditched because some Americans would be future net tax consumers.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Many progressive "libertarians" and so-called "left-libertarians" go even further and accuse anyone who cares about possible cultural or demographic tradeoffs to immigration of being hateful, bigoted, or pejoratives ending in -ist or -phobic. I don't care at all what those confused, relativist egalitarians think or mindlessly regurgitate.
[^fn-2]: I can confidently assume that Richman's post was particularly in response to a resurgence of debate about this topic on "liberty Twitter" in early March. If I recall correctly, the whole thing started due to comments made by libertarian comedian Dave Smith somewhere against the "open borders" position and its libertarian advocates.
[^fn-3]: Except, of course, if absolutely everyone was in perfect, unanimous agreement, which is obviously practically impossible in any existing voting population.
