For this month's post, I want to do something different. This time, instead of presenting articles in the rough chronological order in which I read them, I'm going to present them in groups by their general topic. I decided to do this in order to contrast different approaches or even opposing views on a subject, and as usual I'll add my thoughts on the matter to the summaries.

### _Why Open Borders Don't Work for Small Countries_

- [Link to article](https://mises.org/mises-wire/why-open-borders-dont-work-small-countries)
- Author: Ryan McMaken
- Date: 2024-01-09
- Source: _Mises Wire_, Ludwig von Mises Institute

In this article, McMaken presents some consequentialist counter-arguments to an open borders policy, focusing on cases and factors that he thinks most open borders advocates ignore, minimize, or dismiss. The "open borders" position is that there should be zero legal restrictions at all on immigration, or near zero restrictions, with the common exception being the denial of entry to known criminals.

McMaken argues that consequentialist arguments for open borders are overwhelmingly focused on the case of immigration of people from lower-income countries to higher-income, developed countries, and that those arguments usually focus on the effects of such immigration on domestic economic factors like productivity and GDP per capita. Meanwhile, different cases of immigration are often not considered at all, and other factors are assumed to remain the same, not acknowledged at all, or dismissed as irrelevant.

In the article, McMaken presents several hypothetical cases along with corresponding real-world examples to elaborate how, in cases of demographic asymmetries between bordering countries of different sizes, an open borders policy could be detrimental to the host population of the smaller country. The general argument is that if enough people of a different ethnic group or political persuasion than the host country immigrate there, the immigrants could influence the host country's policies in a direction that jeopardizes the rights of the original inhabitants, perhaps catastrophically.

I highly recommend reading the article, it's very well redacted and the author's argument is clear and convincing. It's true that open borders advocates tend to focus on the familiar case of economic immigration to developed countries while ignoring or dismissing more complex cases and possible perils in the political reality of implementing open borders. I have nothing to add to the cases he presents and the practical concerns they raise, so I'm not going to go into detail here; read his words directly.

I will now briefly discuss some important points regarding this topic. For deontological libertarians, such as myself, the primary or even sole criterion in the immigration debate is adherence to principle; in other words, what does libertarian legal theory imply in this matter. Most libertarians who advocate for open borders do so on deontological grounds, and they're often quick to dismiss these consequentialist considerations and tradeoffs as secondary, irrelevant, or even non-existent.[^fn-1] My position is that they're mostly wrong even on deontological grounds; the implications of libertarian legal theory on this matter are more nuanced. However, I won't elaborate on my position yet; I'll summarize my position on the next section which presents a contrasting article to this one, and further elaborate on the subsequent section which presents the inspiration for my position.


### _Immigration in an Nth-Best World_

- [Link to article](https://www.betonit.ai/p/immigration-in-an-nth-best-world)
- Author: Sheldon Richman (guest post)
- Date: 2024-03-07

This is a guest post on libertarian economist Bryan Caplan's Substack by Sheldon Richman, a notable libertarian scholar and friend of Caplan. In this article, Richman responds to recent arguments made by certain libertarians trying to justify government restrictions on immigration or even "closed borders."[^fn-2]

Richman acknowledges that we live in an "Nth-best" world, neither fully libertarian nor fully totalitarian, all countries having some variation of a mixed economy. This Nth-best situation presents nuanced and thorny issues to which libertarians must present concrete, realistic proposals, beyond simply reciting the non-aggression obligation, if we want to be relevant. However, whatever proposals we advocate must not violate the fundamental ethical principles of libertarianism.

Richman argues that libertarians who defend government restrictions on immigration are wrong and defying basic libertarian principles. In particular, he attacks two of the most common arguments made by libertarians for immigration restrictions, which I'll roughly summarize as follows, trying to stay close to how he presents them in the article:

1. "We the people" (native residents or legal citizens) are the true or rightful owners of government-controlled property, therefore "we" have the right to set rules for entry and use (presumably decided through voting), and therefore "we" could exclude non-owners (foreigners) as desired; some additionally say that "we" _should_ exclude them for various reasons.
2. Immigrants (some, most, or all) are or would be net tax consumers, that is, they consume more in government services or expenditures (particularly welfare) than they contribute in taxes, therefore more immigration would result in an increased tax burden on the native population or perhaps even a fiscal disaster (particularly under an open borders policy).

Regarding the first argument, Richman correctly concedes that the opposite position, that government should set zero rules on "public" property, is a naive, illogical position that is not required by principle and is mostly advocated by some new "social-media" libertarians. However, he also correctly explains that it doesn't follow that the government could set _any_ rule whatsoever on "public" property, as that would effectively mean that virtually any kind of tyrannical requirements could be imposed, which is obviously incompatible with libertarian principles. Furthermore, democratic voting doesn't make the government legitimate or guarantee good or efficient policy choices;[^fn-3] there is no such thing as a "general will of The People"[^fn-4] and in any voting system there would be a portion of the voters who would be against the chosen rules.[^fn-5]

So which rules are permissible and by what criteria? Richman proposes a non-disruption principle, that is, the principle must be to restrict or forbid only those actions which disrupt taxpayers' peaceful use of government-controlled property for its intended purpose.[^fn-6] Therefore, for example, doing drugs in a public park, defecating or camping on a public sidewalk, yelling in a public library, or walking naked into a public elementary school can all be rightfully forbidden by the goverment, and those who do those things can be expelled through (proportional) force if necessary. Crucially for the topic of immigration, this principle does not allow the government to forbid natives from hiring, hosting, trading with, or in general associating peacefully with anyone they want to, even if they're foreigners.

Regarding the second argument, I must clarify that Richman doesn't actually spell it out in the article; I spelled it out here for clarity, in my own words. Instead, he just addresses the concern about the (immigrant-caused) tax burden and goes straight to trying to refute it by appealing to the arguments on Caplan's book advocating for open borders and to the data examined by the Cato Institute. Echoing Caplan, Richman argues that the data doesn't back that fear, that even under open borders the burdensome immigrant would be the exception rather than the rule, and that in any case that would not justify restricting the principle of free immigration, just as we don't ditch the principle of free reproduction because some newborn natives would be future net tax consumers.

Now that I've elaborated on Richman's arguments, I'll elaborate what my position on the matter is. Basically, I mostly agree on principle but I disagree on some details, I think that there are other important concerns he doesn't address, and thus I don't share his attitude.

First, I completely agree with Richman regarding reasonable rules on government-controlled property: as long as the government exists and controls "public" property, it can and should set rules according to the principle of minimizing disruption to taxpayers' peaceful use of the property for its intended purpose, and pretty much all further restrictions and obligations are illegitimate coercion. We could maybe add the principle that rules should be in accordance with the pre-existing local culture, if applicable.

Regarding immigration specifically, I agree that the need for reasonable rules on government-controlled property does not by itself justify any arbitrary restriction on immigration, much less a blanket prohibition. However, I think some reasonable rules can and should be imposed, as long as the government continues to assume the role of domestic security provider and to control "public" property. Specifically, I think the government should impose a single entrance requirement for prospective immigrants: a contractual invitation by a property owner able and willing to host them on his property, at no one else's expense. No caps, no quotas, no fees, no visas, no employment or investment restrictions, no absurd bureaucratic paperwork, no lotteries, no endless waiting lists, just that requirement; but, of course, also no subsidies, no welfare, no public housing, and no anti-discrimination laws. The scheme I favor is based on the one proposed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe, which I'll present in the next section in more detail; for now, I'll say that the rationale for this requirement is to approximate an anarcho-capitalist order, minimizing both forced separation and forced integration.

Second, I agree that the possibility that immigrants would increase the net tax burden on natives does not, by itself, justify arbitrarily restricting immigration, just as it doesn't justify restricting reproduction; the few restrictions I think are justified are based on different criteria specific to immigration, as I'll elaborate on the next section.

Third, the data presented by the Cato Institute, for example, is focused on the United States which, despite popular claims to the contrary, has a labyrinthine, restrictive immigration policy,[^fn-7] and as a result there is an imperfect selection effect toward higher income, less problematic immigrants than there would be under an open borders policy.[^fn-8] Therefore, it's wrong to non-chalantly extrapolate statistics about current immigrants in the United States[^fn-9] to predictions about the hypothetical immigrant population under an open borders policy. Logically, not only would the immigrant population be probably much greater, but it would be of a lower quality on average; _ceteris paribus_, the average immigrant would have lower intelligence, lower income, a higher propensity for crime, less compatibility with the local culture, and a higher likelihood to be a net tax burden than under the very imperfect restrictive status quo.

Look no further than the European Union countries, which have had a less selective immigration policy than the United States, and predictably they've received immigrants of a notably lower quality on average, much more likely to be a net tax burden and to commit crimes than the native population. These issues have created strong anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, and many have started reversing course, most notably Denmark.[^fn-10]

My point is that concerns about the effects of immigration on government spending and taxes, crime, and culture, as well as the geopolitical concerns explained in McMaken's article, are understandable and have a basis in reality. Demographics are important. Advocates of free immigration like Caplan and Richman too easily dismiss these concerns, though they're among the most logical and even-handed on the open borders camp. It's true, adherence to libertarian principles should be non-negotiable, as well as being accurate and not hysterical in evaluating practical effects, but I think a more complete analysis of the practical considerations at hand should make us not so optimistic about open borders. Furthermore, as I mentioned before and as I will elaborate next, libertarian legal theory does not imply that the government must have an open borders policy.


### _The Case for Free Trade and Restricted Immigration_

- [Link to article](https://mises.org/journal-libertarian-studies/case-free-trade-and-restricted-immigration)
- Author: Hans-Hermann Hoppe
- Date: 2014-07-30
- Source: _Journal of Libertarian Studies 13, Number 2 (1998)._ Ludwig von Mises Institute.

I actually read this article probably more than a year ago and, as mentioned in the previous section, I've come to the position that the proper Nth-best libertarian immigration policy would be one similar to the one proposed by Hoppe in this article. While writing the previous section, I read Hoppe's article again, and I finally decided to include it in this post in order to delve into it in some detail and highlight some quibbles I have with it.

Hoppe starts the article by stating his purpose: arguing that free trade and restricted immigration are not only compatible policies, but actually mutually reinforcing. Before elaborating his main argument, Hoppe briefly restates, for the sake of completeness, the logical case for free trade and refutation of protectionist fallacies; his explanation is so rigurous yet concise and easy to read that it should be published as a short, standalone post on mises.org and shared by all of us free traders when making the case for free trade to any smart layman.

**WIP**

In a polycentric legal order according to libertarian natural law, also known as a private law society, everything would be private property, and property owners would have the absolute right to legitimately exclude anyone from their property, as well as the corollary right to allow or invite anyone to their property. People would be free to invite and host, hire, trade with, or associate with anyone they want, regardless of origin, on whatever terms they want, and anyone who doesn't want to do so can choose to abstain from doing so and exclude them from their property. Property owners could also contractually agree to impose common restrictions on who they allow on each of their properties. Thus, some areas could have severe restrictions on which immigrants (if any) they invite or allow in, some could be extremely permissive and inviting, and most places would be somewhere in between. The key point is no one would be forcibly excluded from where they are welcome, no one would be forcibly included where they are not welcome, and nobody would be forced to subsidize anyone else. "Immigration" would be an irrelevant concept, legally speaking.

The entire problem with immigration in our world, from a libertarian perspective, can thus be reduced to forced exclusion and forced inclusion imposed by the goverment. Forced exclusion because the government restricts, taxes, or forbids the entrance of wanted immigrants, those who have someone willing to host them on their private property and at no one else's expense. Forced inclusion because, at the same time, government allows or even subsidizes the entrance of unwanted immigrants, those who have no one willing to host them on their private property and at no one else's expense; furthermore, in many countries people are legally forbidden from discriminating against these unwanted immigrants and excluding them from their businesses, and in some particularly insane regimes it's illegal to criticize this state of affairs. Needless to say, the obvious result of these distortions is to make actual immigrants much more likely on average to be unproductive, parasitic, criminal, and unadapted to the local culture, than the immigrants that would have been received in a private law society.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Many progressive "libertarians" and so-called "left-libertarians" go even further and accuse anyone who cares about possible cultural or demographic tradeoffs to immigration of being hateful, bigoted, or pejoratives ending in -ist or -phobic. I don't care at all what those confused, relativist egalitarians think or mindlessly regurgitate.
[^fn-2]: I can confidently assume that Richman's post was particularly in response to a resurgence of debate about this topic on "liberty Twitter" in late February to early March. If I recall correctly, the whole thing started due to libertarian comedian Dave Smith making comments somewhere against the "open borders" position and its libertarian advocates.
[^fn-3]: In fact, prominent libertarians have convincingly argued that we should expect the opposite, that is, that democratic government, _ceteris paribus_, systematically produces _worse_ policy in the long run than monarchy, for example, due to the higher time preference and all-against-all mentality it incentivizes in the rulers and the population. For an elaboration of this argument, read Hans-Hermann Hoppe's book [_Democracy: The God That Failed_](https://mises.org/library/book/democracy-god-failed); for an empirical counter-argument, read Richard Hanania's article [_The Reactionary Case for Democracy_](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-reactionary-case-for-democracy). My opinion is somewhere in between, but I lean more toward the anti-democracy side; maybe I'll elaborate in the future.
[^fn-4]: Except, of course, if absolutely everyone was in perfect, unanimous agreement, which is obviously practically impossible in any existing voting population.
[^fn-5]: Obviously this is also the case for voting in private organizations (e.g. shareholder or executive meetings, some clubs, etc.), but it's fundamentally different: private organizations are formed and joined voluntarily, so the voters consented to the voting mechanism beforehand, unlike government (no, there's no magical "social contract" that just happens to align with the state's structure and interests), and members have the freedom to disassociate or leave the organization (i.e., sell their shares, quit the job, cancel club membership, etc.), also unlike government (you have to physically move to another regional monopoly jurisdiction most likely very far away, if you're lucky).
[^fn-6]: This is of course on top of the fundamental libertarian legal prohibition on initiatory force against others' private property, i.e., theft, assault, murder, rape, kidnapping, fraud, and such.
[^fn-7]: Yes, the United States does accept thousands and thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, progressive NGOs game the system to assist the "legal" entrance and subsidization of unwanted immigrants, and many unwanted immigrants illegally enter through the southern border, also in many cases with the support of progressive NGOs and shadowy financers, and that's bad. However, the truth is that their number is orders of magnitude smaller than it would probably be if the United States actually had an open borders policy or similar. Also, if I recall correctly most illegal immigrants are actually formerly legal immigrants that overstay their visa, but I don't have a source at hand (give me a break, this article is already long enough).
[^fn-8]: The selection effect is imperfect because of the labyrinthine, inconsistent and often self-defeating nature of American immigration policy. For example, while on the one hand it purportedly tries to attract peaceful, productive, highly skilled immigrants, it also imposes caps, quotas, and potentially hundreds of pages of paperwork requirements on them. The very complexity of immigration law naturally imposes a mild selection effect for those who have the mental capacity to make sense of the requirements and/or for those who have enough money to pay a decent lawyer specialized on immigration policy (income being correlated with intelligence, as we all know). NGOs gaming the system for unwanted immigrants, on average of lower income and intelligence, of course reduces the selection effect.
[^fn-9]: Many immigration restrictionists are prone to claim that the statistics are somehow wrong or biased. Based on my attentive but non-thorough look at it, in my opinion the data provided by the Cato Institute is correct, though of course some sophisticated critiques may have merit. In any case, assume it's correct for the sake of argument.
[^fn-10]: [_The Effects of Immigration in Denmark_](https://inquisitivebird.substack.com/p/the-effects-of-immigration-in-denmark) by Inquisitive Bird provides a comprehensive yet concise analysis of relatively recent official statistics by the Danish government about the net fiscal contribution and the violent crime conviction shares of different demographic groups. Based on the fiscal contribution data, non-Western immigrants and their families have a notably lower average net fiscal contribution than natives and Western immigrants at all ages, and in particular immigrants from MENAPT countries (Middle East, North Africa, Pakistan, and Turkey) have a net negative fiscal contribution (i.e., they're a net tax burden) at all ages. Based on the violent crime convictions data, non-Western immigrants and their descendants are laso massively over-represented, even after adjusting for age and sex. If you don't trust the anonymous author, even The Economist can't hide this reality and in their article titled [_Why have Danes turned against immigration?_](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/12/18/why-have-danes-turned-against-immigration) they provide the [same graphic of average net fiscal contribution by demographic](https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20211218_EUC232.png). Regarding the particularly negative impact of MENAPT immigrants and their singling out in the fiscal contribution statistics, I must emphasize that the separate MENAPT category was introduced by the Danish government precisely because of the notably higher crime rates, lower employment rates, and less integration of immigrants from those countries; read [this article](https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/news/denmark-new-statistics-category-migrants-muslim-countries_en).
