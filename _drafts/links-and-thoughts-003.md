For this month's post, I want to do something different. This time, instead of presenting articles in the rough chronological order in which I read them, I'm going to present them in groups by their general topic. I decided to do this in order to contrast different approaches or even opposing views on a subject, and as usual I'll add my thoughts on the matter to the summaries.

## Immigration

### _Why Open Borders Don't Work for Small Countries_

- [Link to article](https://mises.org/mises-wire/why-open-borders-dont-work-small-countries)
- Author: Ryan McMaken
- Date: 2024-01-09

In this article, McMaken presents some consequentialist counter-arguments to an open borders policy, focusing on cases and factors that he thinks most open borders advocates ignore, minimize, or dismiss. The "open borders" position is that there should be zero legal restrictions at all on immigration, or near zero restrictions, with the common exception being the denial of entry to known criminals.

McMaken argues that consequentialist arguments for open borders are overwhelmingly focused on the case of immigration of people from lower-income countries to higher-income, developed countries, and that those arguments usually focus on the effects of such immigration on domestic economic factors like productivity and GDP per capita. Meanwhile, different cases of immigration are often not considered at all, and other factors are assumed to remain the same, not acknowledged at all, or dismissed as irrelevant.

In the article, McMaken presents several hypothetical cases along with corresponding real-world examples to elaborate how, in cases of demographic asymmetries between bordering countries of different sizes, an open borders policy could be detrimental to the host population of the smaller country. The general argument is that if enough people of a different ethnic group or political persuasion than the host country immigrate there, the immigrants could influence the host country's policies in a direction that jeopardizes the rights of the original inhabitants, perhaps catastrophically.

I highly recommend reading the article, it's very well redacted and the author's argument is clear and convincing. It's true that open borders advocates tend to focus on the familiar case of economic immigration to developed countries while ignoring or dismissing more complex cases and possible perils in the political reality of implementing open borders. I have nothing to add to the cases he presents and the practical concerns they raise, so I'm not going to go into detail here; read his words directly.

I will now briefly discuss some important points regarding this topic. For deontological libertarians, such as myself, the primary or even sole criterion in the immigration debate is adherence to principle; in other words, what does libertarian legal theory imply in this matter. Most libertarians who advocate for open borders do so on deontological grounds, and they're often quick to dismiss these consequentialist considerations and tradeoffs as secondary, irrelevant, or even non-existent.[^fn-1] My position is that they're mostly wrong even on deontological grounds; the implications of libertarian legal theory on this matter are more nuanced. However, I won't elaborate on my position yet; I'll do that on the next section which presents a contrasting article.


### _Immigration in an Nth-Best World_

- Author: Sheldon Richman (guest post)

This is a guest post on libertarian economist Bryan Caplan's Substack by Sheldon Richman, a notable libertarian scholar and friend of Caplan. In this article, Richman responds to recent arguments made by certain libertarians trying to justify government restrictions on immigration or even "closed borders."[^fn-2]

Richman acknowledges that we live in an "Nth-best" world, neither fully libertarian nor fully totalitarian, all countries having some variation of a mixed economy. This Nth-best situation presents nuanced and thorny issues to which libertarians must present concrete, realistic proposals, beyond simply reciting the non-aggression obligation, if we want to be relevant. However, whatever proposals we advocate must not violate the fundamental ethical principles of libertarianism.

Richman argues that libertarians who defend government restrictions on immigration are wrong and defying basic libertarian principles. In particular, he attacks two of the most common arguments made by libertarians for immigration restrictions, which I'll roughly summarize as follows, trying to stay close to how he presents them in the article:

1. "We the people" (native residents or legal citizens) are the true or rightful owners of government-controlled property, therefore "we" have the right to set rules for entry and use (presumably decided through voting), and therefore "we" could exclude non-owners (foreigners) as desired; some additionally say that "we" _should_ exclude them for various reasons.
2. Immigrants (some, most, or all) are or would be net tax consumers, that is, they consume more in government services or expenditures (particularly welfare) than they contribute in taxes, therefore more immigration would result in an increased tax burden on the native population or perhaps even a fiscal disaster (particularly under an open borders policy).

Regarding the first argument, Richman correctly concedes that the opposite position, that government should set zero rules on "public" property, is a naive, illogical position that is not required by principle and is mostly advocated by some new "social-media" libertarians. However, he also correctly explains that it doesn't follow that the government could set _any_ rule whatsoever on "public" property, as that would effectively mean that virtually any kind of tyrannical requirements could be imposed, which is obviously incompatible with libertarian principles. Furthermore, democratic voting doesn't make the government legitimate or guarantee good or efficient policy choices;[^fn-3] there is no such thing as a "general will of The People"[^fn-4] and in any voting system there would be a portion of the voters who would be against the chosen rules.[^fn-5]

So which rules are permissible and by what criteria? Richman proposes a non-disruption principle, that is, the principle must be to restrict or prohibit only those actions which disrupt taxpayers' peaceful use of the government-controlled property in question for its intended use.[^fn-6] Therefore, for example, doing drugs in a public park, defecating or camping on a public sidewalk, yelling in a public library, or walking naked into a public elementary school can all be rightfully prohibited by the goverment, and those who do those things can be expelled through (proportional) force if necessary. Crucially for the topic of immigration, this principle does not allow the government to forbid natives from hiring, hosting, trading with, or in general associating peacefully with anyone they want to, even if they're foreigners.

Regarding the second argument, I must clarify that Richman doesn't actually spell it out in the article; I spelled it out here for clarity, in my own words. Instead, he just addresses the concern about the (immigrant-caused) tax burden and goes straight to trying to refute it by appealing to the arguments on Caplan's book advocating for open borders and to the data examined by the Cato Institute. Echoing Caplan, Richman argues that the data doesn't back that fear, that even under open borders the burdensome immigrant would be the exception rather than the rule, and that in any case that would not justify restricting the principle of free immigration, just as we don't ditch the principle of free reproduction because some newborn natives would be future net tax consumers.

Now that I've elaborated on Richman's arguments, I'll elaborate what my position on the matter is. Basically, I mostly agree on principle but I disagree on some details, I think that there are other important concerns he doesn't address, and thus I don't share his attitude.

First, I completely agree with Richman regarding reasonable rules on government-controlled property: as long as the government exists and controls "public" property, it can and should set rules according to the principle of minimizing disruption to taxpayers' peaceful use of the property for its intended purpose, and pretty much all further restrictions and obligations are illegitimate coercion. We could maybe add the principle that rules should be in accordance with the pre-existing local culture, if applicable.

Now, focusing on the topic of immigration specifically, I agree that the need for reasonable rules on government-controlled property does not by itself justify restrictions on immigrations, much less draconian restrictions and blanket prohibitions. However, I think some reasonable rules can and should be imposed, as long as the government controls public property, particularly infrastructure, and assumes responsibility for international travel security. Specifically, I think government should impose a single requirement for prospective immigrants: verifiable proof that they have somewhere to live once they arrive, that is, proof that they have someone willing and able to host them (family, friends, or anyone else), or proof that they already own or rent a residence (e.g. acquired on a previous visit or, much less likely, from abroad). No caps, no quotas, no fees, no visas, no absurd bureaucratic paperwork, just that requirement; but, of course, also no subsidies, no welfare, no public housing, and no anti-discrimination laws. Let's take a bigger picture to explain why.

In a polycentric legal order according to libertarian natural law, also known as a private law society, everything would be private property, and property owners would have the absolute right to legitimately exclude anyone from their property, as well as the corollary right to allow or invite anyone to their property. People would be free to invite and host, hire, trade with, or associate with anyone they want, regardless of origin, on whatever terms they want, and anyone who doesn't want to do so can choose to abstain from doing so and exclude them from their property. Property owners could also contractually agree to impose common restrictions on who they allow on each of their properties. Thus, some areas could have severe restrictions on which immigrants (if any) they invite or allow in, some could be extremely permissive and inviting, and most places would be somewhere in between. The key point is no one would be forcibly excluded from where they are welcome, no one would be forcibly included where they are not welcome, and nobody would be forced to subsidize anyone else. "Immigration" would be an irrelevant concept, legally speaking.

The entire problem with immigration in our world, from a libertarian perspective, can thus be reduced to forced exclusion and forced inclusion imposed by the goverment. Forced exclusion because the government restricts, taxes, or forbids the entrance of wanted immigrants, those who have someone willing to host them on their private property and at no one else's expense. Forced inclusion because, at the same time, government allows or even subsidizes the entrance of unwanted immigrants, those who have no one willing to host them on their private property and at no one else's expense; furthermore, in many countries people are legally forbidden from discriminating against these unwanted immigrants and excluding them from their businesses, and in some particularly insane regimes it's illegal to criticize this state of affairs. Needless to say, the obvious result of these distortions is to make actual immigrants much more likely on average to be unproductive, parasitic, criminal, and unadapted to the local culture, than the immigrants that would have been received in a private law society.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Many progressive "libertarians" and so-called "left-libertarians" go even further and accuse anyone who cares about possible cultural or demographic tradeoffs to immigration of being hateful, bigoted, or pejoratives ending in -ist or -phobic. I don't care at all what those confused, relativist egalitarians think or mindlessly regurgitate.
[^fn-2]: I can confidently assume that Richman's post was particularly in response to a resurgence of debate about this topic on "liberty Twitter" in late February to early March. If I recall correctly, the whole thing started due to libertarian comedian Dave Smith making comments somewhere against the "open borders" position and its libertarian advocates.
[^fn-3]: In fact, prominent libertarians have convincingly argued that we should expect the opposite, that is, that democratic government, _ceteris paribus_, systematically produces _worse_ policy in the long run than monarchy, for example, due to the higher time preference and all-against-all mentality it incentivizes in the rulers and the population. For an elaboration of this argument, read Hans-Hermann Hoppe's book [_Democracy: The God That Failed_](
https://mises.org/library/book/democracy-god-failed); for an empirical counter-argument, read Richard Hanania's article [_The Reactionary Case for Democracy_](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/the-reactionary-case-for-democracy). My opinion is somewhere in between, but I lean more toward the anti-democracy side; maybe I'll elaborate in the future.
[^fn-4]: Except, of course, if absolutely everyone was in perfect, unanimous agreement, which is obviously practically impossible in any existing voting population.
[^fn-5]: Obviously this is also the case for voting in private organizations (e.g. shareholder or executive meetings, some clubs, etc.), but it's fundamentally different: private organizations are formed and joined voluntarily, so the voters consented to the voting mechanism beforehand, unlike government (no, there's no magical "social contract" that just happens to align with the state's structure and interests), and members have the freedom to disassociate or leave the organization (i.e., sell their shares, quit the job, cancel club membership, etc.), also unlike government (you have to physically move to another regional monopoly jurisdiction most likely very far away, if you're lucky).
[^fn-6]: This is of course on top of the fundamental libertarian legal prohibition on initiatory force against others' private property, i.e., theft, assault, murder, rape, kidnapping, fraud, and such.
