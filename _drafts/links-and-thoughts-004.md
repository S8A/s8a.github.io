## _Towards a Philosophy of Household Management_

- [Link to article](https://www.artofmanliness.com/lifestyle/homeownership/towards-a-philosophy-of-household-management/)
- Authors: Brett & Kate McKay
- Date: 2024-03-26
- Source: _The Art of Manliness_

In this article, Brett and Kate outline a general philosophy of household management, inspired by two books: Cheryl Mendelson's _Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House_, [^fn-aom-1] and Aristotle's _Oikonomikos_. [^fn-aom-2] As they explain, modern people live without _context_ for _why_ they do the things they do, from big things like work, marriage, and having children to smaller things like household management. Thus, the authors sketch out a philosophy to contextualize household management and explain its broader purpose.

The article is relatively short and well-written, so I won't go into too much detail here, and I highly recommend reading it directly. I'll summarize the article as follows: The ultimate purpose (_telos_) of a home is to help the individuals living within it achieve their personal _telos_. Household management [^fn-aom-3] contributes to this purpose in two ways: it directly develops many virtues or excellences, and it creates a home environment conducive to the development of further excellences. The authors explain the virtues developed by household management and how a well-managed household helps develop further virtues. They conclude by exhorting us to embrace this philosophy and see household management as a means to a nobler end.

In this article, "Arctotherium" reviews the 1934 _magnum opus_ of English anthropologist Joseph Daniel Unwin, titled _Sex and Culture_. [^fn-arctotherium-1] First, he provides a comprehensive summary of Unwin's methodology, model, and findings. Secondly, he applies Unwin's model to a novel case (Japan) and then to modern Western countries, to check that Unwin's predictions hold up. Next, he compares Unwin's explanation of his findings with three alternative explanations that he thinks are much better. Finally, he gives his verdict to summarize his review of the book, and concludes by briefly reflecting on the future implications of the book's findings. I highly recommend reading the article, but I'll briefly summarize each section.

In the book, Unwin conducted an inductive survey of 80 "uncivilized" societies and 6 "civilized" societies throughout 5000 years of history. [^fn-arctotherium-2] Unwin's model classified societies based on their rites into four categories that tended to correspond to different levels of cultural achievement, as measured by their "social energy" and their historical memory. "Social energy" refers to a society's display of those powers that are exclusively human, namely reason, creation, and self-reflection. Unwin also categorized societies based on their sexual opportunity, which is the inverse of the level of sexual restraint they observed. Of course, complex societies have different strata of people, which can fall into different categories; Unwin recognizes this and classifies complex societies by their dominant stratum.

Unwin found a perfect correspondence between the level of sexual restraint and the cultural category of societies, in other words, a positive correlation between cultural achievement and sexual restraint. Thus, Unwin's most important finding is that a decrease in sexual opportunity _always_ leads to greater social energy, and vice versa, though the implications of a change take about three generations to fully manifest themselves. Crucially, however, he found that reducing the sexual opportunity of men only matters if the sexual opportunity of women has been reduced to a minimum. Depressingly, Unwin found that the process by which absolute monogamy is first modified and ultimately abolished is the same in every society; thus, it's apparently inevitable that societies that become prosperous become increasingly liberal in their sexual morality, resulting in the decay or even conquest of the society due to reduced social energy.

Arctotherium evaluates Unwin's findings by applying his model to a case that Unwin didn't know much about, Japan from the Meiji restoration onwards, and concludes that Unwin's predictions held up. Likewise, he shows that the trajectory of Western countries in the last 60 years or so seems to match Unwin's predictions: decreasing sexual restraint (Sexual Revolution), particularly of women, has led to decreasing social energy and thus stagnation and decay, accross many metrics.

Next, he explains why Unwin's explanation of his own findings is deficient. Unwin, based on then-current Freudian psychoanalysis, provides a straightforward psychological explanation: an inability to satisfy sexual desires causes people to display this frustrated energy as social energy. However, this completely fails to explain the crucial finding that men's sexual restraint doesn't matter until women's sexual restraint is maximized. Also, Unwin hopes that somehow female emancipation can be achieved while retaining absolute monogamy for an extended period and thus avoid cultural decline, but his own study shows that in all societies so far, female emancipation comes with relaxed sexual restraints.

Arctotherium then provides three alternative explanations for Unwin's findings that are much more solid. He included the first two explanations in [his article](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/the-western-european-marriage-pattern) about the Western European Marriage Pattern, which I featured in my [_Links and thoughts_ #1 (January 2024)]({% link _posts/2024-01-31-links-and-thoughts-001.md %}) post. [^fn-arctotherium-3] To summarize, these are his three explanations, which are not mutually exclusive:

1. Paternal certainty incentivizes men to do great things for his descendants, both in terms of providing a material inheritance as well as a lasting legacy. Only absolute monogamy and absolute polygamy provide absolute paternal certainty, and less sexual restraint for women necessarily implies greater paternal uncertainty. [^fn-arctotherium-4] In particular, absolute monogamy is notably superior to absolute polygamy because it produces more cooperation, since men don't have to constantly compete with each other to take each other's wives or constantly conquer neighboring societies to take theirs.
2. Different regimes of sexual restraint incentivize and select for different traits and behaviors. Absolute monogamy incentivizes and selects for productive, pro-social traits and behaviors that lead to economic success. Absolute polygamy incentivizes and selects for prowess in military conquest and defecting on other men to get more women for yourself. And societies where women have a high degree of sexual choice incentivize intrasexual competition instead of greater achievements, and select for attractiveness to women, which includes some good traits but also some improductive and anti-social traits.
3. Female emancipation directly causes both decreasing sexual restraint and cultural decline, independently of each other. A possible way in which female emancipation could cause cultural decline is through greater female cultural influence, considering that women are _on average_ more conformist and sentimental than men. [^fn-arctotherium-5] On the other hand, while under absolute monogamy both sexes have to restrain their instincts, [^fn-arctotherium-6] a freer sexual marketplace benefits the average woman much more than the average man, so female emancipation incentivizes women to push for relaxing sexual restrictions.

His verdict for the book is that Unwin comes close to his ambitious goal of explaining the universal cause of cultural achievement and decline throughout all of human history. Even though Unwin's interpretation of his own findings is flawed, his model and his empirical discoveries are sound. Arctotherium adds that the biggest blindspot in the book is that Unwin doesn't consider genetics as a factor in human cultural achievement; he considers that a society's sex relations explain the _direction of change_ but not the _absolute level_ of its social energy, and that we have abundant evidence that heritable traits like intelligence play a large role in determining a culture's achievements. [^fn-arctotherium-7] His last criticism is stylistic, explaining that Unwin is very verbose and often repetitive; he hopes that a new edition could clean up the style and perhaps expand the analysis to more civilizations.

Finally, in the last section of implications for the future, Arctotherium concludes with good news and bad news. The good news is that a lot of big modern problems can be mostly solved by re-establishing absolute monogamy and maintaining it for several generations. The bad news is that the societies studied by Unwin that tried to do so were all conquered before achieving it, and thus decline is seemingly inevitable, as mentioned before. The glimmer of hope is that two civilizations, the Sumerians and the Anglo-Saxons, successfully re-imposed absolute monogamy after being conquered, and rose again.

I liked Arctotherium's summary and review of Unwin's book, and I thoroughly agree with his criticisms of Unwin's interpretation of his findings, and I think his alternative explanations are much better. As mentioned before, he included the first two alternative explanations in an article I featured previously here, and I agreed with them then just as I do now. Regarding the third explanation, I think it's reasonable to think that it also plays some role in producing the correlation found by Unwin. I'm not optimistic about the prospects of major Western countries re-establishing absolute monogamy or something close to it any time soon, but I think there's at least potential for voluntary separation and concentration of like-minded people in intentional communities, both to influence local policy and to form parallel systems.

Now, I want to explore some relevant considerations from a libertarian perspective. To start, in the anarcho-capitalist framework, marriages would be private contracts between the spouses that deal with their marriage vows, the management of their property, the custody of their children, conditions for separation, material penalties for breaching the terms of the contract, etc. Like any other contract, a valid marriage contract would require the non-coerced agreement of both parties involved, i.e., the prospective spouses. [^fn-arctotherium-8] Furthermore, a contract would be just an agreement for the conditional transfer of property, and thus the only enforceable obligations would be transfers of property when certain conditions are met. [^fn-arctotherium-9] Couples would be able to tailor their marriage contract to their particular preferences, with a myriad of possible conditions and arrangements, though of course we can expect that the vast majority of people in a particular region would tend to converge to a sort of standard contract template.

Obviously, this framework is not compatible with a regime of true absolute monogamy as it was practiced historically, in which women were relegated to being legal non-entities completely subjugated to their husbands or fathers, and in many cases had no say at all in choosing who they would marry. [^fn-arctotherium-10] However, a marriage contract could be _extremely_ traditional if the spouses agree to that. Likewise, people could voluntarily live by conservative social mores, enforce these social norms on their property, and form contractual covenants with their like-minded neighbors to enforce these norms in common. Thus, if an anarcho-capitalist community has an overwhelming preference for that type of marriage, as well as a culture of absolute monogamy, so to speak, it would have all the practical effects of absolute monogamy.

So, voluntary near-absolute monogamy is possible in anarcho-capitalism, but the question is how common it would actually be; my guess is that it would be practiced only by a minority of people. Let me be clear, I think that modern Leviathan states implement many policies that artificially dilute, distort, and disincentivize marriage and sexual retraint, and repealing these policies would notably improve the status quo and perhaps even reverse the trends of declining fertility and increasing dysgenics. [^fn-arctotherium-11] Thus, I think it's reasonable to predict that marriage contracts would be more traditional than the status quo, but I don't think that most people would choose an _extremely_ traditional arrangement over a more moderate one. Based on Unwin's work, this regime of modified monogamy would not be enough for a society to achieve its highest potential.

If we reasonably assume that near-absolute monogamy would likely be practiced by a minority of people, and we also consider that anarcho-capitalism itself, and right-libertarianism more generally, is evidently a very unpopular ideology, what can we do if we want a truly free, flourishing society? Massive cultural change through persuasion only is very unlikely for several reasons I won't go into. An effective long-term strategy requires _demographic_ change, in other words, outbreeding the rest of the population of a particular region for several generations in order to become the new majority. Realistically, of course, this strategy also requires concentration on a relatively small region to have a reasonable probability of success within the timespan of, for example, three generations.

To summarize, for an anarcho-capitalist society (or something close to it) to emerge and achieve its highest potential, the best strategy seems to be this: smart, absolutely monogamous anarcho-capitalists, or right-libertarians more generally, should intentionally cluster together in a particular region, form parallel private institutions, live according to their traditional sexual mores, and outbreed the general population for several generations.

[^fn-aom-2]: [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3TRgnRB) for Aristotle's book _Oikonomikos_ translated to English (titled _Economics_). Alternatively, I found [this free electronic copy of an English translation](https://archive.org/details/oeconomica01arisuoft/page/n11/mode/2up) titled _Oeconomica_. The McKays explain that while the book title is usually translated as _Economics_, the Greek word _oikonomikos_ is better translated as _household management_, and Aristotle's book deals precisely with that topic. For a summary of Aristotle's thought on economics across his many works, analyzing it from the perspective of modern Austrian economic theory, read [this article](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/05/050915-11.htm) by Edward W. Younkins.
[^fn-aom-3]: "[...] which includes cleaning, organizing, maintenance, and budgeting, as well as safety and home defense"
[^fn-arctotherium-1]: The author provides [this link](https://archive.org/details/b20442580/mode/2up) to a free electronic copy of the book. Be warned that it's more than 700 pages long.
[^fn-arctotherium-2]: The distinction between civilized and uncivilized societies is not a key portion of Unwin's model, and he himself says that it's just a rough, arbitrary classification. Unwin defined "civilized" societies as the following: _"Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Hellenes, Persians, Hindus, Chinese, Japanese, Sassanids, Arabs (Moors), Romans, Teutons, and Anglo-Saxons (i.e. ourselves)."_ The six "civilized" societies that Unwin chose to study were the Sumerians, Babylonians, Hellenes, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and English, with a few comments about the Arabs and Moors. Unwin explains that he limited his survey to those societies for which he had reliable evidence, and encourages the reader to test his conclusions on other societies through alternative measures.
[^fn-arctotherium-3]: I actually found Arctotherium's review of J. D. Unwin's book because he linked to it in his _The Baby Boom_ article. I got around to reading it in March, but I didn't have time to write about it until April.
[^fn-arctotherium-4]: Paternity tests were obviously not invented until recently in the scale of human history, and thus men still have their natural evolved instincts in this matter.
[^fn-arctotherium-5]: Even if the difference is apparently small _on average_, we know that men have greater variability in many traits than women. Thus, men are over-represented in the extreme ends of intelligence, risk-taking, unconventional thinking, etc.
[^fn-arctotherium-6]: Arctotherium encapsulates the sexes' natural instincts perfectly in a footnote, which I'll quote directly: "Men's instincts tend towards polygamy, having sex with many women at the same time, ideally with exclusive sexual access and always retaining the option to branch out further. Women's instincts tend towards hypergamy, having sex with the most attractive man, ideally while receiving investment (not necessarily from the same man) and always retaining the option to trade up." Absolute monogamy is the perfect equilibrium that restrains both sexes' instincts for the benefit of all.
[^fn-arctotherium-7]: For example, in [last month's _Links and thoughts_ post]({% link _posts/2024-03-31-links-and-thoughts-003.md %}), I featured two articles about a paper that found that national average IQ is overwhelmingly the best predictor for economic growth.
[^fn-arctotherium-8]: It should be obvious, but I'll clarify that, for this consent to be legally valid, both prospective spouses would have to be adults with enough mental capacity to independently understand and agree to the terms of the contract, as well as the nature and activities inherent to a marital relationship.
[^fn-arctotherium-9]: This means that a contract cannot directly force one of its parties to perform or to abstain from performing a particular act, but can force that person to yield some particular property as a penalty for doing so. This is called the title-transfer theory of contract, famously explained and defended by Murray Rothbard in Chapter 19 (_Property Rights and the Theory of Contracts_) of his book [_The Ethics of Liberty_](https://cdn.mises.org/The%20Ethics%20of%20Liberty%2020191108.pdf) (1998, 2nd ed.).
[^fn-arctotherium-10]: Absolute polygamy, as historically practiced, is also obviously incompatible with the anarcho-capitalist framework for the same reasons, but I'll focus on absolute monogamy since that is the most socially desirable arrangement.
[^fn-arctotherium-11]: In [January's _Links and thoughts_ post]({% link _posts/2024-03-31-links-and-thoughts-003.md %}), I featured two articles by Arctotherium related to this topic.
[^fn-arctotherium-12]: For some time now, I've been thinking that something along these lines is the best and possibly the only realistic strategy to create a libertarian society. Intentional geographical clustering of liberty-minded people, parallel voluntary institutions, secession, and similar strategies are frequently advocated by libertarian authors, so I was already familiar with and sympathetic to those strategies. Notably, the [Free State Project](https://www.fsp.org/) is a real-world movement with the goal of getting libertarians to concentrate in New Hampshire to turn the tide against government there; despite not yet reaching the critical mass of libertarians that was originally hoped for, they've already achieved a notable though not major influence on the state's politics. In the past six months or so, I've been reading many articles on sociobiology, and I've integrated many insights from them into my worldview, adjusting my expectations and opinions on strategy accordingly. Incidentally, I recently read the article [_The Extinction of the Dark Elves_](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/the-extinction-of-the-dark-elves) by Joseph Bronski, in which he elaborates a strategy, similar to the one I propose, for "dark elves" (right-wing, fit, high-IQ, white people) to cluster in a particular region, voluntarily practice traditional marriage unrestricted, reproduce, and flourish; the main differences are that he is not a libertarian, his criteria for belonging to his desired hypothetical community are too strict in my opinion, he completely excludes non-whites, and he supports widespread embryo selection while I have ethical concerns about it.
