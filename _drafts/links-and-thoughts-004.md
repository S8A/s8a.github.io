## _Towards a Philosophy of Household Management_

In this article, Brett and Kate outline a general philosophy of household management, inspired by two books: Cheryl Mendelson's _Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House_, [^fn-aom-1] and Aristotle's _Oikonomikos_. [^fn-aom-2] As they explain, modern people live without _context_ for _why_ they do the things they do, from big things like work, marriage, and having children to smaller things like household management. Thus, the authors sketch out a philosophy to contextualize household management and explain its broader purpose.

The article is relatively short and well-written, so I won't go into too much detail here, and I highly recommend reading it directly. I'll summarize the article as follows: The ultimate purpose (_telos_) of a home is to help the individuals living within it achieve their personal _telos_. Household management [^fn-aom-3] contributes to this purpose in two ways: it directly develops many virtues or excellences, and it creates a home environment conducive to the development of further excellences. The authors explain the virtues developed by household management and how a well-managed household helps develop further virtues. They conclude by exhorting us to embrace this philosophy and see household management as a means to a nobler end.

## Footnotes

[^fn-aom-1]: [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3vfJmFu) for Mendelson's book _Home Comforts_.
[^fn-aom-2]: [Amazon link](https://amzn.to/3TRgnRB) for Aristotle's book _Oikonomikos_ translated to English (titled _Economics_). Alternatively, I found [this free copy of an English translation](https://archive.org/details/oeconomica01arisuoft/page/n11/mode/2up) titled _Oeconomica_. The McKays explain that while the book title is usually translated as _Economics_, the Greek word _oikonomikos_ is better translated as _household management_, and Aristotle's book deals precisely with that topic. For a summary of Aristotle's thought on economics across his many works, analyzing it from the perspective of modern Austrian economic theory, read [this article](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/05/050915-11.htm) by Edward W. Younkins.
[^fn-aom-3]: "[...] which includes cleaning, organizing, maintenance, and budgeting, as well as safety and home defense"
