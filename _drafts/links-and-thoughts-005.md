In this article, Cremieux Recueil presents several cases from different regions and time periods that illustrate how elite groups form through processes of selection (both endogenous and exogenous) and thus become genetically different from the rest of the population. The author examines studies and data about the Samurai and Kazoku, the Kulin Brahmin, Egyptian Copts, Jews, and Indo-Fijians, among other cases. The article is very interesting and well-researched; I definitely recommend it.

### _Where parents make a difference_

Inquisitive Bird criticizes both the common view that denies the importance of nature (genetic inheritance) and the opposite view that denies the effect of nurture. In this article, he focuses on the latter claim because others on his “side” of the debate (hereditarians) often assert it, and he thinks it’s not accurate based on the behavior genetics literature. This article summarizes several high-quality studies on the effects of nature and nurture on certain important social outcomes (educational attainment, income, crime, and net wealth) in order to show that parenting does have an important effect on these outcomes, though genetic effects are still roughly twice as impactful.

### _Do parents make a difference?_

In this article, Joseph Bronski responds to the Inquisitive Bird article linked above from a hereditarian perspective as well. Bronski confirms that the article's research is mostly good, and he agrees that, for _social outcomes_, genetics predominate but the shared environment has a small but measurable effect. However, Bronski provides several important critiques, the main one being that Inquisitive Bird obscures the crucial distinction between social outcomes and physical traits by focusing exclusively on the former, which are intuitively less heritable than the latter. Furthermore, he points out that even for some social traits, parents don't influence their children at all through the shared environment, only through genes, and some traits show that the non-shared environment (outside the home) has an effect while the shared environment has none; in particular, he provides some charts from his forthcoming book, showing that this is the case for political views on the liberalism-conservatism scale, social attitudes, and moral values.

The secondary critique is that Inquisitive Bird apparently ignored some important limitations of the paper by _Isungset et al._ (2022). Inquisitive Bird claimed that the paper provides compelling evidence that birth order effects on educational attainment originate in the post-natal environment, but Bronski proposed mutational load as a better explanation. Bronski later edited the article to add some statistical simulations to deal with an objection. He later edited it again to admit his simulations were wrong and to propose an alternative explanation consistent with mutational load theory. I admit I don't know enough statistics to judge that whole section.
