## _How to Do Great Work_

Paul Graham, known for being one of the founders of [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Y_Combinator&oldid=1225221718), wrote this essay explaining the general recipe for doing great work in any field. Great work takes many forms, but in general, it's characterized by greatness in ambition and impact; in the best cases, the result is the creation or discovery of an entirely new field. It should go without saying, but Graham explicitly says that his guide is for very ambitious people. The essay contains lots of practical wisdom and motivation&mdash;too much to summarize in a sentence or two. However, I think this quote is the best encapsulation of Graham's recipe for doing great work:

> Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

This essay, by the eminent libertarian historian Ralph Raico, originally appeared in a 1999 book titled [_The Costs of War: Americaâ€™s Pyrrhic Victories_](https://store.mises.org/Costs-of-War-P80.aspx). Raico provides a critical biography of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War, citing plenty of high-quality sources. In mainstream history and media, the image of Churchill is that of a hero, a wise strategist, and a principled statesman, widely lauded across most of the political spectrum. Raico's essay dispels the Churchill myth entirely, exposing him for what he really was: an opportunistic and unprincipled politician, a bloodthirsty and short-sighted war criminal, and one of the godfathers of the destructive Leviathan of the modern welfare-warfare state.
