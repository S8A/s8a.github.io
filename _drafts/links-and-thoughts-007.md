The author's introductory paragraph summarizes the article perfectly, so I'll just quote it directly:

> I track the historical rise of West Europe by quantitatively analyzing the birth of notable people of science, and then I put it in context with other indicators of historical development. The data together show that West Europe had developmentally surpassed the rest of the world prior to 1500 A.D., before the establishment of overseas colonies or slavery. It is clear that the Westâ€™s rise to global prominence has deeper roots than often suspected.

This article provides a comprehensive look at data from various sources about the IQ of Jewish people inside and outside of Israel. To summarize, here are the main takeaways:

- Ashkenazi Jews' overrepresentation in high-IQ professions and achievements is consistent with an average IQ between 110 and 115.
- Based on several psychometric test results from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, where Jews are overwhelmingly Ashkenazim, their average IQ must be somewhere between 110 and 113.
- On the other hand, Israel is obviously the country with the most Jews, but most of them aren't Ashkenazim. Ethnic mixing and personal misidentification create room for misclassification error in Israel-based studies, which is why they're separate. Long story short, here is the estimated population share and average IQ of each Israeli Jewish subgroup:
    - 44.9% are Mizrahim (Arab Jews) with a mean IQ of about 83.
    - 31.8% are Ashkenazim (Central/Eastern European Jews) with a mean IQ of about 112.
    - 12.4% are Soviets (immigrants from the collapsing USSR) with a mean IQ of about 100.
    - 7.9% are mixed with a mean IQ of about 100.
    - 3% are Ethiopians with a mean IQ of about 70.
