This is a long, detailed piece split into three articles that argues against the mutational load hypothesis for the rise of leftism, of which Joseph Bronski is perhaps the strongest proponent. [^fn-1] The mutational load hypothesis has two premises: that mutational load, that is, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, [^fn-2] has increased since at least the Industrial Revolution as a result of technological and economic advances, [^fn-3] and that mutational load causes leftism; [^fn-4] and its conclusion is that increased mutational load is the main, ultimate, or even the sole cause for the almost uninterrupted rise of leftism throughout the world in the last few centuries and especially in the West.

In the first part, the author explains the mutational load hypothesis, the strong evidence showing that mutational load has indeed increased in the modern era, and the scarce and weak evidence that it partially causes leftism. In the second part, the author shows that even assuming that both premises are true, the conclusion that mutational load has caused the leftward political shift does not hold because the _magnitude_ of the effect is insufficient to explain the shift. In the third part, the author analyzes three historical case studies&mdash;the decline of Ancient Rome, the political trajectories of Quebec and France, and breeder cults like Haredim Jews and the Amish&mdash;to  demonstrate that mutational load cannot plausibly be the cause of large increases in leftism.

In the author's own words, here are the conclusions (direct quote):

1. Even assuming mutational load is directly connected to left-wing politics (which is still not clear), this does not imply mutational load accumulation played a nontrivial role in Western political shifts. The magnitude of the shift is far larger than the change in a similar trait, intelligence caused by load. 
2. Mutational load played no role in Roman (or any other premodern empire) decline, and to the extent that modern Western decline parallels the decline of older empires, this is evidence against the MLH, not for it.
3. The best natural experiment we have, Quebec vs France, gives the opposite result as predicted by the MLH.
4. Genetic change causing political change is overwhelmingly a function of immigration (strongly inclining politics to the left). With the (important) exception of the Anglosphere settler colonies, which promoted immigration for economic and security reasons in the 19th and early 20th centuries, mass immigration is the result of previous leftwards shifts in politics. It is a positive feedback loop, but the initial impetus is politics, not genetics. Selection (weakly inclining politics to the right) is secondary. There is no detectable signal of mutational load. The overwhelming majority of political change is not due to genetic changes.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Read, for example, [_How important is the elite in wokeism?_](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/how-important-is-the-elite-in-wokeism), a brief article in which Bronski states the mutational load hypothesis as follows: "leftism is a psychological defect caused by high mutational load induced by the low selection pressures of modernity."  He provides various graphs and links to studies which purportedly support the hypothesis.
[^fn-2]: In a footnote, the author clarifies that the technical definition of mutational load focuses on mutations that are deleterious to fitness, but in this case he (and presumably Bronski as well) is referring to "_de novo_ mutations that degrade function (adaption execution) rather than fitness (number of surviving offspring)."
[^fn-3]: As the author explains, the increase in mutational load was mostly due to drastically decreased child mortality, which reduces purifying selection. Increased paternal age, the other cause of mutational load, surprisingly didn't increase across the board throughout the 20th century; in the early 20th century, people had their first child earlier but they also continued to have them until later ages, so these effects cancelled each other out.
[^fn-4]: In a footnote, the author says that, for the purposes of the article, leftism is defined as "the decay of group-selected behavior," which I would say is synonymous with anti-civilizational behavior, and he lists the following as indicators of leftism: "Feminism (particularly the decline of absolute monogamy and the loosening of sexual restraints on women), irreligiosity, lowered ethnocentrism, socialism, and promotion of sexual deviancy."
