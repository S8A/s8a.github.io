## _Against the Mutational Load Hypothesis_

This is a long, detailed piece split into three articles that argues against the mutational load hypothesis for the rise of leftism, of which Joseph Bronski is perhaps the strongest proponent. [^fn-1] The mutational load hypothesis has two premises: that mutational load, that is, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, [^fn-2] has increased since at least the Industrial Revolution as a result of technological and economic advances, [^fn-3] and that mutational load causes leftism; [^fn-4] and its conclusion is that increased mutational load is the main, ultimate, or even the sole cause for the almost uninterrupted rise of leftism throughout the world in the last few centuries and especially in the West.

1. In the first part, the author explains the mutational load hypothesis, the strong evidence showing that mutational load has indeed increased in the modern era, and the scarce and weak evidence that it partially causes leftism.
2. In the second part, the author shows that even assuming that both premises are correct, the _magnitude_ of the effect of mutational load on leftism cannot plausibly be large enough to explain such a large leftward political shift.
3. In the third part, the author analyzes three historical case studies to further demonstrate that mutational load cannot plausibly be the cause of large increases in leftism: the decline of Ancient Rome, the political trends of Quebec and France, and the persistent rightism of breeder cults like Haredim Jews and the Amish.

Overall, it seems to me that Arctotherium makes a strong case against the mutational load hypothesis, and most likely mutational load is at best a secondary factor in the rise of leftism.

## _Nice Things and Why We Can't Have Them_

- Author: Marcel Dumas Gautreau

In this article, Gautreau provides a very interesting and fun to read explanation of the O-ring theory of economic development and its implications. The theory basically explains that some production processes, called O-ring production processes, [^fn-5] have two important distinctive features: the value of the entire product depends on all tasks of the process being completed successfully, and quantity can't substitute for quality. Gautreau eloquently explains how these features of O-ring production processes result in increasing returns to skill and positive assortative matching for skill levels, and other related interesting implications including:
- How one person can, intentionally or unintentionally, destroy significantly more value than their labor was worth.
- Why small differences in quality can result in large differences in output and thus wages.
- Why high-skill firms hire higher-quality workers for higher wages even for lower-skill tasks.
- How the quantity of high-skill people in a company or country increases the incentive for investment in human capital.
- How differences in skill levels affect the patterns of specialization, trade, and immigration.

The article is a very interesting and accessible read, with many funny and quotable parts. I'll highlight two of my favorite quotes, one from around the middle of the article, and one from the end:

> I repeat myself: life isn’t fair, and man is an unequal creature. Unequal people get unequal incomes, and there’s nothing that will change that.
{: .fst-italic.ps-4.border-start.border-5}

> [...] The material benefits of this delicate productive arrangement are clear to every enterprise in a capitalist system.
>
> The challenge is in avoiding the disasters to life, liberty, and property that emerge from skill mismatches.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Read, for example, [_How important is the elite in wokeism?_](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/how-important-is-the-elite-in-wokeism), a brief article in which Bronski states the mutational load hypothesis as follows: "Leftism is a psychological defect caused by high mutational load induced by the low selection pressures of modernity."  He provides various graphs and links to studies that purportedly support the hypothesis.
[^fn-2]: In a footnote, the author clarifies that the technical definition of mutational load focuses on mutations that are deleterious to fitness, but in this case he is referring to "_de novo_ mutations that degrade function (adaption execution) rather than fitness (number of surviving offspring)." Presumably, Bronski is using the term in the same manner.
[^fn-3]: As the author explains, the increase in mutational load was mostly due to drastically decreased child mortality, which reduces purifying selection, while the other possible cause, increased paternal age, didn't play a significant role. The author points out that paternal age surprisingly didn’t increase across the board throughout the 20th century. While people in the early 20th century started having children earlier, they also continued to have them for longer, so the average paternal age stayed roughly constant.
[^fn-4]: In a footnote, the author says that, for the purposes of the article, leftism is defined as "the decay of group-selected behavior," and he lists the following as indicators of leftism: "Feminism (particularly the decline of absolute monogamy and the loosening of sexual restraints on women), irreligiosity, lowered ethnocentrism, socialism, and promotion of sexual deviancy." In other words, he defines leftism as anti-civilizational beliefs and behavior, which I find not only amusing but also very accurate.
[^fn-5]: "The name is a reference to the 1986 [_Challenger_ shuttle disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster&oldid=1238602171), a catastrophe caused by the failure of [O-rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O-ring&oldid=1229211936)." &ndash; [O-ring theory of economic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=O-ring_theory_of_economic_development&oldid=1196934817), Wikipedia.
