This is a long, detailed piece split into three articles that argues against the mutational load hypothesis for the rise of leftism, of which Joseph Bronski is perhaps the strongest proponent. [^fn-1] The mutational load hypothesis has two premises: that mutational load, that is, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, [^fn-2] has increased since at least the Industrial Revolution as a result of technological and economic advances, [^fn-3] and that mutational load causes leftism; [^fn-4] and its conclusion is that increased mutational load is the main, ultimate, or even the sole cause for the almost uninterrupted rise of leftism throughout the world in the last few centuries and especially in the West.

1. In the first part, the author explains the mutational load hypothesis, the strong evidence showing that mutational load has indeed increased in the modern era, and the scarce and weak evidence that it partially causes leftism.
2. In the second part, the author shows that even assuming that both premises are correct, the _magnitude_ of the effect of mutational load on leftism cannot plausibly be large enough to explain such a large leftward political shift.
3. In the third part, the author analyzes three historical case studies to further demonstrate that mutational load cannot plausibly be the cause of large increases in leftism: the decline of Ancient Rome, the political trends of Quebec and France, and the persistent rightism of breeder cults like Haredim Jews and the Amish.

Overall, it seems to me that Arctotherium makes a strong case against the mutational load hypothesis, and most likely mutational load is at best a secondary factor in the rise of leftism.

## Footnotes

[^fn-1]: Read, for example, [_How important is the elite in wokeism?_](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/how-important-is-the-elite-in-wokeism), a brief article in which Bronski states the mutational load hypothesis as follows: "Leftism is a psychological defect caused by high mutational load induced by the low selection pressures of modernity."  He provides various graphs and links to studies that purportedly support the hypothesis.
[^fn-2]: In a footnote, the author clarifies that the technical definition of mutational load focuses on mutations that are deleterious to fitness, but in this case he is referring to "_de novo_ mutations that degrade function (adaption execution) rather than fitness (number of surviving offspring)." Presumably, Bronski is using the term in the same manner.
[^fn-3]: As the author explains, the increase in mutational load was mostly due to drastically decreased child mortality, which reduces purifying selection, while the other possible cause, increased paternal age, didn't play a significant role. The author points out that paternal age surprisingly didnâ€™t increase across the board throughout the 20th century. While people in the early 20th century started having children earlier, they also continued to have them for longer, so the average paternal age stayed roughly constant.
[^fn-4]: In a footnote, the author says that, for the purposes of the article, leftism is defined as "the decay of group-selected behavior," and he lists the following as indicators of leftism: "Feminism (particularly the decline of absolute monogamy and the loosening of sexual restraints on women), irreligiosity, lowered ethnocentrism, socialism, and promotion of sexual deviancy." In other words, he defines leftism as anti-civilizational beliefs and behavior, which I find not only amusing but also very accurate.
