## _The Cost of Apathy._

The tweet says: 'The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.'"/>

This article is a call to introspection and to action. It's about a problem that primarily applies to white-collar workers in first-world countries but also applies to different degrees to everyone whose real income is above subsistence level: basically, the inertial tendency to coast through a boring and/or comfortable job (particularly well-paid, low-stress desk jobs) and to live a mediocre, repetitive, boring day-to-day existence for years and decades, until it's too late. That's what Raines calls "the apathetic life," and he emphasizes that the opportunity cost of such a way of living is life itself&mdash;our limited time in this world and the foregone challenges, experiences, and achievements that make life worth living. Other authors have addressed this topic before, but I happened to stumble upon the article, and I liked that it explains the issue in such a way that makes you viscerally understand and fear the cost of an apathetic life. The clock is ticking.

> The point of life is to live, and living isnâ€™t a spectator sport.

## _How to Understand the Well-Being Gap between Liberals and Conservatives_

<img class="w-100" src="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gharbi-2.jpg" alt="Chart showing the percentage share of conservatives, moderates, and 'liberals' answering Yes to the question 'Has a doctor or other healthcare provider EVER told you that you have a mental health contidion?', controlling for religious service attendance frequency."/>

This essay provides a detailed overview of the ideological well-being gap, its different facets, and the robust evidence supporting it. The ideological well-being gap refers to the fact that conservatives tend to be happier and more well-adjusted than "liberals" (progressives or leftists would be more accurate), a pattern observed both in the United States and other Western countries. Based on the available evidence, the author explains the most likely drivers of the observed patterns, most notably: that there are some genetic/biological factors that simultaneously underlie both ideology and well-being; that conservatism _per se_ may help people cope with adversity; and that some types of leftist ideology _per se_ exacerbate and incentivize unhealthy thought patterns.
