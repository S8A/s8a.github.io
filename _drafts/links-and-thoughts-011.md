As the author clarifies halfway through the article, the title is intentionally facetious. The general thesis of the article is that the Ottoman Empire's incursions into Southeastern Europe in the 16th century forced European rulers and the Catholic Church to allow the Protestant movement to survive, unlike previous heretical movements, and even to accommodate them in exchange for support against the invaders; then, due to the inherent pluralism of Protestant creeds and the insufficient coordination and effectiveness of most of the new Protestant political rulers, Protestants were more often than not unable to suppress scientific and intellectual progress like their Catholic counterparts; as a result, intellectual and scientific progress could flourish in Protestant regions, paving the way for the scientific and industrial revolutions and thus the unprecedented prosperity of the modern era. Cremieux makes a compelling case for his thesis, citing some solid historical literature as well as statistical data from several studies.

I'll briefly add that Joseph Bronski wrote a much shorter post in response, [_The Eugenic Origins of Modernity_](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/the-eugenic-origins-of-modernity), in which he argues that Cremieux's article fails to consider an important factor, particularly in the part about the rise in scientists per capita in Protestant cities relative to Catholic ones: genetic evolution driven by differences in selection pressures between the two groups. I think it's a plausible point, but it comes across as mere speculation compared to the heaps of data Cremieux presents.
