It seems to be most frequent in populations with a longer history of reading and writing, particularly if the writing system uses sound-based characters (Mekel-Bobrov et al., 2005).">

This article primarily argues that the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region of the human brain that helps us recognize written letters and words, was subject to relatively recent gene-culture coevolution. As summarized by Frost:

> It may therefore be that humans first identified words by using face-recognition neurons. Then, as the ability to read became more important, natural selection favored those individuals who could free up more of those neurons for reading. The eventual outcome was a large neuronal population dedicated solely to word recognition, i.e., the VWFA.

He then explains a general outline of the stages of this process and addresses some objections. Next, he reasons that different human populations may have evolved to become better at reading and writing to different extents because they had different levels of selection for these abilities, and he provides evidence for differences in VWFA development and activation between and within human populations. Hopefully, researchers at some point will question the now untenable yet still dominant assumption that reading and writing are too recent to have played a role in human evolution, and they could follow Frost's suggestions for testing his alternative model.
