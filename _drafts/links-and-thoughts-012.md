## _Recent evolution of the ability to read and write_

It seems to be most frequent in populations with a longer history of reading and writing, particularly if the writing system uses sound-based characters (Mekel-Bobrov et al., 2005).">

This article primarily argues that the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region of the human brain that helps us recognize written letters and words, was subject to relatively recent gene-culture coevolution. As summarized by Frost:

> It may therefore be that humans first identified words by using face-recognition neurons. Then, as the ability to read became more important, natural selection favored those individuals who could free up more of those neurons for reading. The eventual outcome was a large neuronal population dedicated solely to word recognition, i.e., the VWFA.

He then explains a general outline of the stages of this process and addresses some objections. Next, he reasons that different human populations may have evolved to become better at reading and writing to different extents because they had different levels of selection for these abilities, and he provides evidence for differences in VWFA development and activation between and within human populations. Hopefully, researchers at some point will question the now untenable yet still dominant assumption that reading and writing are too recent to have played a role in human evolution, and they could follow Frost's suggestions for testing his alternative model.

## _Responding to Bryan Caplan's Continued Critique of the Austrians_

The description of the video perfectly summarizes the episode, so I'll quote it directly:

> In 1997, Bryan Caplan wrote an essay explaining why he was no longer a self-described Austrian. Recently, a reader asked him to comment on that essay. Bob reacts to Bryan's current views, arguing that the history of economic thought is indeed important, and the Misesian approach to praxeology is crucial.

Caplan's 1997 essay is [_Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist_](https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm), while his latest post (the one that Murphy is responding to) is [_Some Austrian Answers_](https://www.betonit.ai/p/some-austrian-answers). I'm not an expert in economics, but I think Murphy made excellent points and that most of Caplan's critiques are misguided. However, I somewhat agree with Caplan's impression that many Austrian economists don't move beyond rehashing the work of Mises, Hayek, etc. I think there is potential for exploring new areas and discovering truly innovative insights using the Austrian framework. I hope Murphy completes his project of fully modeling the financial sector, for example. Another avenue that I've often thought has a lot of untapped potential is fleshing out the details of how an anarchocapitalist society could work, beyond the general explanations we already have, and to make more thorough and insightful comparisons with the status quo and other alternative political arrangements.

## _Worldwide height variation explained_

In this article, Kirkegaard gives a detailed overview of the new paper he co-authored with David Piffer, [_Polygenic Selection and Environmental Influence on Adult Body Height: Genetic and Living Standard Contributions Across Diverse Populations_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/polygenic-selection-and-environmental-influence-on-adult-body-height-genetic-and-living-standard-contributions-across-diverse-populations/07C50FF8A272043CFEFC71AABA379AFA). They demonstrated that statistical models that include both genetic and environmental predictors best explain population differences in adult body height. As he explains, they used polygenic scores (PGS) for height from different types of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to account for the possible biases and confounding factors of each type. Also, they used two methods to control for any autocorrelation in the data, and their findings still held up and were statistically significant.
