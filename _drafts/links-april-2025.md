- Lecture video: _[Keynes: IS-LM, Socialism, and Modern Macroeconomics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZYAFaHSsZY)_ by Edward Fuller (2025-03-24). This lecture was given at the 2025 Austrian Economics Research Conference hosted by the Ludwig von Mises Institute. I actually watched it when it was being livestreamed last month, but I forgot to add it to the link compilation.
- _[Nick Land's Esoteric Platonism](https://sphinxe.substack.com/p/nick-lands-esoteric-platonism)_ by S&phi;inx (2024-10-19).
- Three articles by Sprachspiele, which convinced me to subscribe to his Substack:
  - _[Response to Bronski on economics](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/response-to-bronski-on-economics)_ (2025-04-20). This is a masterful takedown of Joseph Bronski's [post where he dismisses neoclassical economics as fake and unscientific](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/steve-keens-critique-of-neoclassical) (2025-04-15), which was so bad that now I'm more skeptical of the rest of his writing. I prefer Austrian economics (in my non-expert opinion), so I think there are solid grounds for critiquing neoclassical economics, but Bronski goes about it in an absurd, hyper-reductionist way that effectively dismisses economic science entirely. In any case, Bronski dismisses Austrian economics as well because he considers it unscientific wordcel slop.
  - _[Leftist morality within the dissident right](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/leftist-morality-within-the-dissident)_ (2023-10-16). Here he points out that many people on the "dissident right" retain a fundamentally leftist morality and thus they make fundamentally leftist arguments, and he argues that this is inconsistent and self-defeating. I strongly agree.
  - _[Limitations of libertarian theory](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/limitations-of-libertarian-theory)_ (2022-11-19). This is a critique of Rothbardian libertarian theory, in particular. I don't agree in general but I do think he makes good points.
- _[Propagandism vs. Realism](https://fakenous.substack.com/p/propagandism-vs-realism)_ by Michael Huemer (2025-04-12).
- _[The fundamental differences between civilized and Tribal warfare](https://reese690162.substack.com/p/the-fundamental-differences-between)_ by Dark Age Sage (2025-02-02).
- New educational online game: _[EthnoGuessr](https://hbd.gg/)_. The game shows you male and female facial averages from a given ethnic group on each round, and you have to guess where they come from (historically) by placing a mark on a map.
