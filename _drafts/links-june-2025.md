## Footnotes

[^fn-rwrr]: That book and lecture series was recommended in [the first article](https://mgautreau.substack.com/p/right-wing-reading-rainbow-i-the) in Marcel Dumas Gautreau's _Right Wing Reading Rainbow_ series of book recommendations. I'll try to work my way through them this year.
[^fn-njoya]: Unfortunately, Njoya read only a screenshot of a fragment of the article posted by Marcel on Twitter, misinterpreted it as if the article was hostile to her, and then proceeded to have an embarrasing angry argument with Marcel while refusing to actually read the full article.
[^fn-arctotherium]: However, I don't agree with his dismissal of other right-wing revisionist views near the end of the article.
