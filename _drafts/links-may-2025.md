- _[How Cursor Indexes Codebases Fast](https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/how-cursor-indexes-codebases-fast)_ by Engineer's Codex (2025-05-10).
- _[MCP: What It Is and Why It Matters](https://addyo.substack.com/p/mcp-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters)_ by Addy Osmani (2025-03-27).
- Two lectures by Marcel Dumas Gautreau at two different conferences hosted by the Ludwig von Mises Institute this year:
  - _[AERC '25 Lecture: German Historical School Revisionism](https://mgautreau.substack.com/p/aerc-25-lecture-german-historical)_ (2025-04-09).
  - _[LSC '25 Lecture: Rothbardian Populism vs. Silicon Valley Straussianism](https://mgautreau.substack.com/p/lsc-25-lecture-rothbardian-populism)_ (2025-05-22).
- The _Biofoundationalism_ essay series by "Dmitry" (Substack: _[The Dosage Makes It So](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/)_), which earned him my subscription. I strongly agree with his Biofoundationalism theory, though with caveats, but not so much with his related Moral Foundations Utility Theory.
  - _[Biofoundationalism I: Moral Foundations Utility Theory & Hypermoralization](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-i-moral-foundations)_ (2024-12-20).
  - _[Biofoundationalism II: The Moral Genotype](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-ii-the-moral-genotype)_ (2025-01-24).
  - _[Biofoundationalism III: Verbal Intelligence and Factual Sediment](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iii-verbal-intelligence)_ (2025-02-21).
  - _[Biofoundationalism IV: Masculine Because You Have To, Feminine Because You Get To](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iv-masculine-because)_ (2025-04-25).
- Other essays by Dmitry that I liked (but not necessarily agreed with entirely) on a variety of topics:
  - _[AI Risk and Modeling the Un-Modelable](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/on-complex-adaptive-systems-investing)_ (2023-09-10).
  - _[The Volatility Tax Must Be Paid](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/the-volatility-tax-must-be-paid)_ (2024-07-20).
  - _[Soft Currencies, Taxation, & Giftcards](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/soft-currencies-taxation-resource)_ (2024-08-04).
  - _[Capitalism, Lions, and the Way of the Beaver](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/capitalism-and-the-way-of-the-beaver)_ (2024-09-16).
  - _[Property Rights, Toilets, and the Way of the Dog](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/property-rights-toilets-and-the-way)_ (2024-10-07).
  - _[Gain Dependents, Gain Power](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/gain-dependents-gain-power)_ (2024-10-23).
  - _[Defeating Nature](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/defeating-nature)_ (2024-12-17).
  - _[Trashbags of Facts and Insipid Oceans](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/trashbags-of-facts-and-insipid-oceans)_ (2025-02-11).
- _[The American Assimilation Myth](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth-america)_ by Inquisitive Bird (2025-04-00).
  - Follow-up expanding the case to international data: _[The Assimilation Myth](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth)_ (2025-05-09). This one is paywalled so I haven't read it entirely, but the argument is the same: ethnic socioeconomic disparities are remarkably persistent.
- _[GDP, yes, but GDP per what?](https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/gdp-yes-but-gdp-per-what)_ by Emil Kirkegaard (2025-05-02).
- Some good data-filled articles by East Hunter:
  - _[Is hereditarianism wrong?](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/is-hereditarianism-wrong)_ (2025-05-22). A response to arguments made by Erik Turkheimer and Sasha Gusev, primarily. Short answer to the title question: no.
  - _[A Copernican Revolution of social science â€“ Race and IQ](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/a-copernican-revolution-of-social-dc5)_ (2024-08-14).
  - _[A Copernican Revolution of social science &ndash; Sex roles](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/a-copernican-revolution-of-social)_ (2024-08-05).
- _[Nonlinear Ethnic Niches](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/nonlinear-ethnic-niches)_ by Arctotherium (2025-05-03).
- _[Elite Human Capital DEBUNKED](https://ubersoy.com/p/elite-human-capital-debunked)_ by UBERSOY (2025-02-02). A response to the ludicrous ragebait concept of "EHC" promoted by Anatoly Karlin and Richard Hanania.
- _[Are Jews White?](https://ubersoy.com/p/are-jews-white)_ by UBERSOY (2025-05-18). Paywalled article, so I haven't read it entirely, but the non-paywalled section is interesting enough to warrant reading, as it mostly goes through his take on the genetic and phenotypical aspect of the debate. The paywalled part is probably more polemic, but I haven't read it so I don't know what it actually says. The subtitle and introduction to the article should be clear enough hints about the general argument though.
  - For more about Jewish genetics and history focused only on the scientific evidence, I recommend these three articles by Razib Khan:
    - _[More than kin, less than kind: Jews and Palestinians as Canaanite cousins](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/more-than-kin-less-than-kind-jews)_ (2023-12-28). Paywalled halfway through, but I managed to read it entirely using a free one-month subscription I randomly received as a gift.
    - _[A coat of many colors: medieval-DNA findings detect interwoven strands of Ashkenazi heritage](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/a-coat-of-many-colors-medieval-dna)_ (2022-12-13).
    - _[Ashkenazi Jewish genetics: a match made in the Mediterranean](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/ashkenazi-jewish-genetics-a-match)_ (2021-09-18). Paywalled halfway through.
    - _[Under pressure: the paradox of the diamond](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/under-pressure-the-paradox-of-the)_ (2021-10-24). Not paywalled.
