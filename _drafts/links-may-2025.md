- _[MCP: What It Is and Why It Matters](https://addyo.substack.com/p/mcp-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters)_ by Addy Osmani (2025-03-27).
- The _Biofoundationalism_ essay series by "Dmitry" (Substack: _[The Dosage Makes It So](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/)_), which earned him my subscription. I strongly agree with his Biofoundationalism theory, though with caveats, but not so much with his related Moral Foundations Utility Theory.
  - _[Biofoundationalism I: Moral Foundations Utility Theory & Hypermoralization](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-i-moral-foundations)_ (2024-12-20).
  - _[Biofoundationalism II: The Moral Genotype](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-ii-the-moral-genotype)_ (2025-01-24).
  - _[Biofoundationalism III: Verbal Intelligence and Factual Sediment](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iii-verbal-intelligence)_ (2025-02-21).
  - _[Biofoundationalism IV: Masculine Because You Have To, Feminine Because You Get To](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iv-masculine-because)_ (2025-04-25).
- Other essays by Dmitry that I liked (but not necessarily agreed with entirely) on a variety of topics:
  - _[AI Risk and Modeling the Un-Modelable](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/on-complex-adaptive-systems-investing)_ (2023-09-10).
  - _[The Volatility Tax Must Be Paid](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/the-volatility-tax-must-be-paid)_ (2024-07-20).
  - _[Soft Currencies, Taxation, & Giftcards](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/soft-currencies-taxation-resource)_ (2024-08-04).
  - _[Capitalism, Lions, and the Way of the Beaver](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/capitalism-and-the-way-of-the-beaver)_ (2024-09-16).
  - _[Property Rights, Toilets, and the Way of the Dog](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/property-rights-toilets-and-the-way)_ (2024-10-07).
  - _[Gain Dependents, Gain Power](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/gain-dependents-gain-power)_ (2024-10-23).
  - _[Defeating Nature](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/defeating-nature)_ (2024-12-17).
  - _[Trashbags of Facts and Insipid Oceans](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/trashbags-of-facts-and-insipid-oceans)_ (2025-02-11).
- _[The American Assimilation Myth](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth-america)_ by Inquisitive Bird (2025-04-00).
  - Follow-up expanding the case to international data: _[The Assimilation Myth](https://inquisitivebird.xyz/p/the-assimilation-myth)_ (2025-05-09). This one is paywalled so I haven't read it entirely, but the argument is the same: ethnic socioeconomic disparities are remarkably persistent.
- Some good data-filled articles by East Hunter:
  - _[Is hereditarianism wrong?](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/is-hereditarianism-wrong)_ (2025-05-22). A response to arguments made by Erik Turkheimer and Sasha Gusev, primarily. Short answer to the title question: no.
  - _[A Copernican Revolution of social science â€“ Race and IQ](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/a-copernican-revolution-of-social-dc5)_ (2024-08-14).
  - _[A Copernican Revolution of social science &ndash; Sex roles](https://easthunter.substack.com/p/a-copernican-revolution-of-social)_ (2024-08-05).
- _[Nonlinear Ethnic Niches](https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/nonlinear-ethnic-niches)_ by Arctotherium (2025-05-03).
- _[Elite Human Capital DEBUNKED](https://ubersoy.com/p/elite-human-capital-debunked)_ by UBERSOY (2025-02-02). A response to the ludicrous ragebait concept of "EHC" promoted by Anatoly Karlin and Richard Hanania.
