- The _Biofoundationalism_ essay series by "Dmitry" (_[The Dosage Makes It So](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/)_), which earned him my subscription. I strongly agree with his Biofoundationalism theory, though with caveats, but not so much with his related Moral Foundations Utility Theory.
  - _[Biofoundationalism I: Moral Foundations Utility Theory & Hypermoralization](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-i-moral-foundations)_ (2024-12-20).
  - _[Biofoundationalism II: The Moral Genotype](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-ii-the-moral-genotype)_ (2025-01-24).
  - _[Biofoundationalism III: Verbal Intelligence and Factual Sediment](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iii-verbal-intelligence)_ (2025-02-21).
  - _[Biofoundationalism IV: Masculine Because You Have To, Feminine Because You Get To](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/biofoundationalism-iv-masculine-because)_ (2025-04-25).
- Other essays by Dmitry that I liked (but not necessarily agreed with entirely) on a variety of topics:
  - _[AI Risk and Modeling the Un-Modelable](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/on-complex-adaptive-systems-investing)_ (2023-09-10).
  - _[The Volatility Tax Must Be Paid](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/the-volatility-tax-must-be-paid)_ (2024-07-20).
  - _[Soft Currencies, Taxation, & Giftcards](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/soft-currencies-taxation-resource)_ (2024-08-04).
  - _[Capitalism, Lions, and the Way of the Beaver](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/capitalism-and-the-way-of-the-beaver)_ (2024-09-16).
  - _[Property Rights, Toilets, and the Way of the Dog](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/property-rights-toilets-and-the-way)_ (2024-10-07).
  - _[Trashbags of Facts and Insipid Oceans](https://thedosagemakesitso.substack.com/p/trashbags-of-facts-and-insipid-oceans)_ (2025-02-11).
- _[Elite Human Capital DEBUNKED](https://ubersoy.com/p/elite-human-capital-debunked)_ by UBERSOY (2025-02-02). A response to the ludicrous ragebait concept of "EHC" promoted by Anatoly Karlin and Richard Hanania.
