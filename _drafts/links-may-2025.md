- Two articles by Ubersoy about Jews:
  - _[Are Jews White?](https://ubersoy.com/p/are-jews-white)_ (2025-05-18). Paywalled article, so I haven't read it entirely. The paywalled part is probably more polemical.

- For more about Jewish genetics but focused only on the scientific evidence, I recommend these articles by Razib Khan:
