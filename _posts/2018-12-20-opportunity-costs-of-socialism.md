Some weeks ago I found [this masterpiece](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/cea-report-opportunity-costs-socialism/). The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) of the United States published this report in October 23rd to coincide with the 200th anniversary of Karl Marx's birth - a not so subtle post-mortem insult to the ideological leader of that destructive ideology.

WORK IN PROGRESS
