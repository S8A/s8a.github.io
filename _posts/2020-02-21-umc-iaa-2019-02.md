I made a long statistical analysis of the accumulated academic scores published by the UMC for the period that just ended (2019-02). I created it as a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook and exported it to HTML to publish it [here]({% link _documents/umc-iaa-2019-02.html %}) in Spanish. Read it, it's all explained there!
