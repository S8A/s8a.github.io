Today I'm sharing the link to my Calculus 4 (CAL444) assignment about the application of differential equations, which I made in [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org) on May 27th, 2019. In this interactive document I explored the Solow-Swan economic growth model, which is a nonlinear system consisting of a single ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the per capita stock of capital. Access the interactive document [here](https://www.geogebra.org/m/zrcqd8hq) (in Spanish).
