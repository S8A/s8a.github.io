Today I completed my Programming 3 (PRO633) project: a tool for managing a database of UMC students and their grades. The GitHub project is [here](https://github.com/S8A/umc-pro633-crud).

It's a command-line application made with [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and the [PyMySQL](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/) library. To use it, the program requires having those two installed plus a [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) instance running.

The installation and use instructions are in the project's README.md, plus some screenshots of the main screens. Everything is there, so go read the document and download the program!
