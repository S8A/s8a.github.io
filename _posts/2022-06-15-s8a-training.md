Two months ago, I completed my project for the Web Programming (PRW703) class at the UMC: 8A Training, a simple web-app for logging training sessions. It can be accessed [here](https://s8a-training.web.app/) (it's in Spanish). The GitHub repository of the project is private, for security reasons.

The assignment was to design and develop a website, of any kind and purpose, in four stages:
1. Basic website using vanilla HTML and CSS.
2. Adding JavaScript for dynamism and form validation.
3. Using a CSS framework to improve the design.
4. Using a backend like [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting and/or data storage.

Each stage had to be marked with a tag in the VCS.

The publicly available version of 8A Training corresponds to the last stage of the project. Its features are:
- Uses Google Firebase as hosting and backend provider.
- Sign-up and sign-in with email and password.
- Training log with dynamic pagination and date filters.
- Dynamic forms for creating or updating training session records.
- Training session detail page with buttons to update or delete the record.

I started working on the project late in the semester because I was busy with other assignments and I hadn't decided what my website project would be, so I had to complete all four stages in less than a month, including learning how to use Firebase for the first time. On top of that, at that time I had no internet connection at home, so I had to work from the university's computer lab, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. almost every day including some weekends.

The web-app turned out well, especially given the circumstances, and I got a perfect score on the assignment. I personally use it regularly to log my training sessions. That's why I intend to keep maintaining it and making some improvements, particularly in the data entry interface, which is honestly a bit cumbersome on mobile.
