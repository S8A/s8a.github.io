- _[There is no such thing as "Rightism"](https://sectionalismnotes.substack.com/p/there-is-no-such-thing-as-rightism)_ by Sectionalism Archive (2025-01-06).
- _[Selective migration and regression towards the mean](https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/selective-migration-and-regression)_ by Emil Kirkegaard (2024-12-31).
- Old but interesting article that the Substack app recommended to me: _[The Church's crusade against cousin-marriage did not create the Western nuclear family](https://policytensor.substack.com/p/the-churchs-crusade-against-cousin)_ by Policy Tensor (2021-05-07). Basically argues that the family structures of different societies originated far before what is often thought and are very persistent, and thus the common narrative that reforms implemented by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages led to the rise of the nuclear family is incorrect. See also [Peter Frost's comment](https://policytensor.substack.com/p/the-churchs-crusade-against-cousin/comment/53110133) briefly arguing that the truth is likely somewhere in between.
- In defense of Richard Lynn's national IQ estimates:
  - _[How To Stop Worrying And Learn To Love Lynn's National IQ Estimates](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/how-to-stop-worrying-and-learn-to)_ by Scott Alexander (2025-01-15).
    - Supplement with _[Highlights From The Comments On Lynn And IQ](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-lynn)_ (2025-01-16).
  - _[National IQs Are Valid](https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/national-iqs-are-valid)_ by Cremieux Recueil (2025-01-16). Probably the most comprehensive defense.
- Against [Lyman Stone's article](https://ifstudies.org/blog/are-we-headed-towards-idiocracy-a-look-at-dysgenic-fertility) arguing that dysgenic fertility is not a generally applicable long-term problem:
  - _[Dysgenics: within and between](https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/dysgenics-within-and-between)_ by Emil Kirkegaard (2025-01-11).
  - _[International dysgenics do matter, national IQs are valid](https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/international-dysgenics-do-matter)_ by Sebastian Jensen (2025-01-18). 
- Razib Khan's summaries of what he considers were the three most important findings on the area of ancient genomics research in 2024:
  - Number 3: _[We were selected: tracing what humans were made for](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/we-were-selected-tracing-what-humans)_ (2024-12-30). Talks about [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.14.613021v1).
  - Number 2: _[The other man: Neanderthal findings test our power of imagination](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/the-other-man-neanderthal-findings)_ (2024-12-31). Talks about [this paper](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/fulltext/S2666-979X(24)00177-0).
  - Number 1: _[We are what we speak: Indo-European phylogenetic and linguistic trees concur](https://www.razibkhan.com/p/we-are-what-we-speak-indo-european)_ (2025-01-18). Talks about [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.17.589597v1). This post is paywalled after the first few sections so I haven't actually read it in full, but what I read so far is good.
- _[ACX Survey Results 2025](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/acx-survey-results-2025)_ by Scott Alexander (2025-01-29).
