- Lecture video: _[Keynes: IS-LM, Socialism, and Modern Macroeconomics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZYAFaHSsZY)_ by Edward Fuller (2025-03-24). This lecture was given at the 2025 Austrian Economics Research Conference hosted by the Ludwig von Mises Institute. I actually watched it when it was being livestreamed last month, but I forgot to add it to the link compilation.
- _[7 simple habits of the best engineers I know](https://read.engineerscodex.com/p/7-simple-habits-of-the-top-1-of-engineers)_ by Engineer's Codex (2023-09-11).
- Three articles by Sprachspiele, which convinced me to subscribe to his Substack:
  - _[Response to Bronski on economics](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/response-to-bronski-on-economics)_ (2025-04-20). This is a masterful takedown of Joseph Bronski's [post where he dismisses neoclassical economics as fake and unscientific](https://www.josephbronski.com/p/steve-keens-critique-of-neoclassical) (2025-04-15), which was so bad that now I'm more skeptical of the rest of his writing. I prefer Austrian economics (in my non-expert opinion), so I think there are solid grounds for critiquing neoclassical economics, but Bronski goes about it in an absurd, hyper-reductionist way that effectively dismisses economic science entirely. In any case, Bronski dismisses Austrian economics as well because he considers it unscientific wordcel slop.
  - _[Leftist morality within the dissident right](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/leftist-morality-within-the-dissident)_ (2023-10-16). Here he points out that many people on the "dissident right" retain a fundamentally leftist morality and thus they make fundamentally leftist arguments, and he argues that this is inconsistent and self-defeating. I strongly agree.
  - _[Limitations of libertarian theory](https://sprachspiele.substack.com/p/limitations-of-libertarian-theory)_ (2022-11-19). This is a critique of Rothbardian libertarian theory, specifically. I don't agree in general but I do think he makes good points.
- Three articles by The American Tribune that deal with the history of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), particularly about how the Western international establishment smeared it and actively aided its communist takeover:
  - _[Egalitarianism Destroyed Rhodesia. It Will Destroy America Too, If We Let it](https://www.theamericantribune.news/p/egalitarianism-destroyed-rhodesia)_ (2024-10-18).
  - _[Why Rhodesia Matters](https://www.theamericantribune.news/p/why-rhodesia-matters)_ (2024-07-31).
  - _[How the United States Supported Genocide in Southern Africa](https://www.theamericantribune.news/p/how-the-united-states-supported-white)_ (2023-08-09). This one is actually about South Africa, but it has a full section talking about the case of Rhodesia.
    - That article in turn links to [this fantastic political-military analysis of the Rhodesian Bush War](https://smallwarsjournal.com/2022/02/25/rhodesian-bush-warzimbabwe-war-liberation/) by William B. Turner (2022-02-25).
- Three articles by Martin Štěpán, senior fellow of the [Natural Law Institute](https://naturallawinstitute.com/) (NLI), which perhaps can best be described as a post-libertarian right-wing think tank:
  - _[Propertarianism](https://natlawinstitute.substack.com/p/propertarianism)_   (2024-11-02). This is an overview of the post-libertarian political/ethical theory advocated by the NLI, explained in comparison with libertarian theory. I'm not quite convinced, though they bring up some interesting points.
  - _[Origins and history of Abrahamism](https://natlawinstitute.substack.com/p/origins-and-history-of-abrahamism)_ (2024-09-26). Very controversial history that would be considered offensive by many groups of people, especially one group in particular. It seems questionable in terms of historicity, but it's interesting nonetheless.
  - _[What Mainstream Right Gets Wrong](https://natlawinstitute.substack.com/p/what-mainstream-right-gets-wrong)_ (2024-07-08).
- _[Nick Land's Esoteric Platonism](https://sphinxe.substack.com/p/nick-lands-esoteric-platonism)_ by S&phi;inx (2024-10-19).
- _[Propagandism vs. Realism](https://fakenous.substack.com/p/propagandism-vs-realism)_ by Michael Huemer (2025-04-12).
- _[The fundamental differences between civilized and Tribal warfare](https://reese690162.substack.com/p/the-fundamental-differences-between)_ by Dark Age Sage (2025-02-02).
- _[State Capitalism (Probably) Failed: Singapore versus Hong Kong](https://menghu.substack.com/p/state-capitalism-probably-failed)_ by Meng Hu (2024-06-24). A review of the econometric literature on the topic.
- _[Hutus and Tutsis and genetics](https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/hutus-and-tutsis-and-genetics)_ by Emil Kirkegaard (2025-03-25).
- New educational online game: _[EthnoGuessr](https://hbd.gg/)_. The game shows you male and female facial averages from a given ethnic group on each round, and you have to guess where they come from (historically) by placing a mark on a map.
