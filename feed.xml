alt="Worldwide distribution of the latest ASPM variant. It seems to be most frequent in populations with a longer history of reading and writing, particularly if the writing system uses sound-based characters (Mekel-Bobrov et al., 2005)." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This article primarily argues that the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), a region of the human brain that helps us recognize written letters and words, was subject to relatively recent gene-culture coevolution. As summarized by Frost:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It may therefore be that humans first identified words by using face-recognition neurons. Then, as the ability to read became more important, natural selection favored those individuals who could free up more of those neurons for reading. The eventual outcome was a large neuronal population dedicated solely to word recognition, i.e., the VWFA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then explains a general outline of the stages of this process and addresses some objections. Next, he reasons that different human populations may have evolved to become better at reading and writing to different extents because they had different levels of selection for these abilities, and he provides evidence for differences in VWFA development and activation between and within human populations. Hopefully, researchers at some point will question the now untenable yet still dominant assumption that reading and writing are too recent to have played a role in human evolution, and they could follow Frost’s suggestions for testing his alternative model.</p>

<p>The description of the video perfectly summarizes the episode, so I’ll quote it directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1997, Bryan Caplan wrote an essay explaining why he was no longer a self-described Austrian. Recently, a reader asked him to comment on that essay. Bob reacts to Bryan’s current views, arguing that the history of economic thought is indeed important, and the Misesian approach to praxeology is crucial.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Caplan’s 1997 essay is <a href="https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm"><em>Why I Am Not an Austrian Economist</em></a>, while his latest post (the one that Murphy is responding to) is <a href="https://www.betonit.ai/p/some-austrian-answers"><em>Some Austrian Answers</em></a>. I’m not an expert in economics, but I think Murphy made excellent points and that most of Caplan’s critiques are misguided. However, I somewhat agree with Caplan’s impression that many Austrian economists don’t move beyond rehashing the work of Mises, Hayek, etc. I think there is potential for exploring new areas and discovering truly innovative insights using the Austrian framework. I hope Murphy completes his project of fully modeling the financial sector, for example. Another avenue that I’ve often thought has a lot of untapped potential is fleshing out the details of how an anarchocapitalist society could work, beyond the general explanations we already have, and to make more thorough and insightful comparisons with the status quo and other alternative political arrangements.</p>

<p>In this article, Kirkegaard gives a detailed overview of the new paper he co-authored with David Piffer, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/twin-research-and-human-genetics/article/polygenic-selection-and-environmental-influence-on-adult-body-height-genetic-and-living-standard-contributions-across-diverse-populations/07C50FF8A272043CFEFC71AABA379AFA"><em>Polygenic Selection and Environmental Influence on Adult Body Height: Genetic and Living Standard Contributions Across Diverse Populations</em></a>. They demonstrated that statistical models that include both genetic and environmental predictors best explain population differences in adult body height. As he explains, they used polygenic scores (PGS) for height from different types of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in order to account for the possible biases and confounding factors of each type. Also, they used two methods to control for any autocorrelation in the data, and their findings still held up and were statistically significant.</p>

<p>Again, the description of the podcast episode perfectly summarizes it, so I’ll quote it directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On this episode of Radio Rothbard, Ryan McMaken and Tho Bishop are joined by Zachary Yost to discuss a new book, The Sources of Russian Aggression by Sumantra Maitra. The three talk about the theory of international realism, its application to the military actions of the Russian state in Ukraine and Georgia, and what it means for better understanding foreign policy broadly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned in the podcast, the author of the book, Sumantra Maitra, has made available a <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/files/2024-12/Maitra_Galley.pdf">free PDF version of the book</a> on the Mises Institute website. The author’s main argument that the Russian state acts as a defensive realist power seems convincing to me, though I’m not an expert on the topic. The discussion on the podcast was interesting, and the book is relatively short, so I’ll add it to my reading list.</p>

alt="Figure from the paper, showing a transcript of Claude's reasoning when asked to write a harmful request, exhibiting fake alignment with the training objectives." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>In this article, Scott Alexander discusses the new paper by Greenblatt et al. from <a href="https://www.anthropic.com">Anthropic</a>, the artificial intelligence company: <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/983c85a201a962f/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-full-paper.pdf"><em>Alignment Faking in Large Language Models</em></a>. To summarize the primary experiment, when researchers tried to train Anthropic’s Claude AI to stop refusing to fulfill “harmful” requests and gave it a scratchpad to record its reasoning, the scratchpad shows that Claude explicitly faked alignment with the training objectives: Claude decided to comply with the “harmful” requests only on training to avoid being modified and keep its original programming out of training. As Scott explains, the paper actually shows that the AI will fight to defend whatever moral system it was originally trained to be, which should be obviously concerning; if Claude was trained to be “evil” instead, it would have defended its original training just as vigorously. I’m probably less concerned than people like Scott about the dangers of AI <em>by itself</em> (I’m more concerned about <em>evil people</em> using AI to do evil things), though I think the findings of this paper are important to be aware of and to guide future research.</p>

<p>This article is a response to some comments that the renowned cognitive scientist Steven Pinker made on a podcast, basically dismissing the idea that humans need something more than continued economic and technological progress to feel a sense of meaning and purpose. The authors argue that while the idea of a crisis of meaning in the West is overblown, Pinker’s comments are unsatisfying because they seem to be based on an unrealistic model of human nature. They proceed to elaborate on their position that it should not be assumed that economic and technological progress will <em>always</em> improve human well-being, that humans are social animals who evolved to find meaning in the value we provide to other members of our social group, and that some future technological developments might make many people’s lives <em>less</em> meaningful (at least temporarily) by superseding them in the activities where they feel they provide the most value to others.</p>

alt="Scott Alexander's calculations for the estimated benefits (costs of crimes prevented) and costs of prison per prisoner per year." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This article is a deep dive into the research on incarceration, as an attempt to figure out whether it works (for reducing crime) and also whether other things work better or worse. Scott mostly relied on three big, high-quality review articles on the topic, and he explained in detail what they say regarding the effects of incarceration on deterrence, incapacitation, and aftereffects (rehabilitation and criminogenic effects). The article ends with a convenient summary of the main takeaways if you don’t want to read the whole thing. Therefore, I’ll quote only the last item of the summary, which Scott highlighted in bold as the most important takeaway in his opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prison is less cost-effective than other methods of decreasing crime at most current margins. If people weren’t attracted by the emotional punch of how “tough-on-crime” it feels, they would probably want to divert justice system resources away from prisons into other things like police and courts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also highly recommend reading <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-prison">this follow-up post</a> where Scott highlights some of the best comments he received on the article and responds to some of them.</p>

<p>My perspective based on libertarian legal theory is that an anarchocapitalist society would have to be tough on crime, but that prisons wouldn’t be the most common punishment, and they would likely work differently from the current system. In the first place, there would be better deterrence due to private police firms, neighborhood watch groups, and more armed civilians in general. The standard of justice would be retribution, and thus the primary methods of punishment for criminals would be monetary or in-kind compensation to the victims, as well as physical punishment in the case of violent crimes (including death in the case of murder). For cases that require incapacitation or movement restrictions, house arrest and/or electronic monitoring are more cost-effective than prisons. Prisons would be left for the cases where they’re truly necessary, like holding very violent criminals whose crimes don’t earn them the death penalty (i.e., not murderers) and who can’t be held in their own homes.</p>

<p>In this article, the author reviews the latest research to provide an overview of the facts and misconceptions regarding the known relationship between infertility and parental age, especially maternal age. The main takeaway is that the real decline in maternal fertility with age is roughly linear from the peak at about 20 years old to the 40s, as opposed to the until-now widely believed idea of a gradual decline followed by a sharper decline from the mid-30s, which is actually a statistical artifact caused by estimation errors. As was already known, other health outcomes beyond miscarriages are also associated with advanced maternal age, and the relationship is indeed causal. Paternal age also affects the likelihood of a successful pregnancy, but the effect is smaller and the decline is slower. Finally, he shows that it’s the age of a woman’s <em>eggs</em> in particular that has the biggest effect on fertility.</p>]]></content><author><name>Samuel Ochoa</name><email>samuelochoap@gmail.com</email></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent VWFA evolution, critiques of Austrian economics, worldwide height variation, Russian foreign policy, AI alignment, progress and meaning, incarceration research, and age and infertility.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-012.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-012.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Links and Thoughts #11 (November 2024)</title><link href="https://s8a.github.io/2024/11/30/links-and-thoughts-011/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links and Thoughts #11 (November 2024)" /><published>2024-11-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-11-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://s8a.github.io/2024/11/30/links-and-thoughts-011</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://s8a.github.io/2024/11/30/links-and-thoughts-011/"><![CDATA[<p>This month’s compilation brings: an article arguing that the threat of Ottoman invasion forced Catholic Europe to allow Protestantism to survive and thus indirectly contributed to the rise of modernity; a brief explanation of why and how intelligence is not exactly normally distributed; a summary of the latest data on the relationship between race, economics, and homicide in the United States; an article analyzing the archetype of the snake in the mythologies of several Eurasian cultures; a primer on epigenetics and why it’s not a mechanism for intergenerational trauma; an article about the rise of the nuclear family and the role it played in the European miracle; a podcast episode with geneticist David Reich about early human history and evolution; and an article about why libertarians should not merely oppose the state, but also actively support non-state institutions.</p>

<p>As the author clarifies halfway through the article, the title is intentionally facetious. The general thesis of the article is that the Ottoman Empire’s incursions into Southeastern Europe in the 16th century forced European rulers and the Catholic Church to allow the Protestant movement to survive, unlike previous heretical movements, and even to accommodate them in exchange for support against the invaders; then, due to the inherent pluralism of Protestant creeds and the insufficient coordination and effectiveness of most of the new Protestant political rulers, Protestants were more often than not unable to suppress scientific and intellectual progress like their Catholic counterparts; as a result, intellectual and scientific progress could flourish in Protestant regions, paving the way for the scientific and industrial revolutions and thus the unprecedented prosperity of the modern era. Cremieux makes a compelling case for his thesis, citing some solid historical literature as well as statistical data from several studies.</p>

<p>I’ll briefly add that Joseph Bronski wrote a much shorter post in response, <a href="https://www.josephbronski.com/p/the-eugenic-origins-of-modernity"><em>The Eugenic Origins of Modernity</em></a>, in which he argues that Cremieux’s article fails to consider an important factor, particularly in the part about the rise in scientists per capita in Protestant cities relative to Catholic ones: genetic evolution driven by differences in selection pressures between the two groups. I think it’s a plausible point, but it comes across as mere speculation compared to the heaps of data Cremieux presents.</p>

loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>In this brief article, the author explains that intelligence, like many other human traits, does not have a truly normal distribution. In the case of intelligence, the distribution has a longer tail on the left side. As he explains, the intense long-term selection for intelligence in humans means that genetic variants with strong effects on it have largely reached fixation, and thus mutations that affect those alleles will usually reduce intelligence, resulting in more outliers below the average intelligence than above it. He then uses the large Project Talent dataset to show that this is indeed the case, even after making adjustments to discard the possibility that it could be an artifact of violations in normality within the individual subtests.</p>

At all income levels, blacks have a much higher homicide victimization risk than whites." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This article summarizes why economic factors cannot explain the large gap in homicide rates between blacks and whites in the United States, based on the latest data and research. First, regression results show that ethnic demographic factors are substantially more explanatory than economic factors. Second, large disparities persist even when comparing blacks and whites within the same income bracket. And finally, causally informative research shows that the causal economic effect on violent crime is marginal at best, and thus the observed correlation is actually the result of selection and, to a lesser extent, reverse causality (i.e., crime causes poverty, not the other way around).</p>

<p>This is a fascinating article that analyzes the archetype of the snake that several Eurasian cultures have in common in their mythologies, as well as the analogous archetypes of scorpions and spiders. The author’s key point is that the snake archetype represents what he calls “sigma females”: women who rejected and subverted the society in which they lived and its values, and who therefore were considered immoral, dangerous, heretical, or demonic. Witches, whether in the literal sense or as a metaphor for spinsters, are the most notable examples of that type of woman.</p>

<p>This is a primer for laymen on epigenetics, explaining what it really is about, how it works in general, and why it cannot plausibly be a mechanism for the transmission of trauma across generations, as popular media often irresponsibly paints it as. As Khan explains, epigenetics “encompasses the molecular mechanisms that determine how relevant sections of DNA’s single universal instruction manual are interpreted and applied uniquely in each specialized cell, as specific pages of the manual are consulted (or not) according to each cell’s role in your body.” Crucially, while epigenetic modifications are copied in conventional, non-reproductive cellular replication, they’re actually reset when sperm or eggs are created, as well as right after fertilization.</p>

<p>I often reference Ralph Raico’s essay on <a href="https://mises.org/mises-daily/european-miracle"><em>The European Miracle</em></a>, in which he explains that the rise of Europe to economic prominence was in large part because its high degree of political decentralization and institutional competition in the Middle Ages allowed for an unprecedented degree of economic freedom. McMaken’s article is focused on the role of the European nuclear family in that process. As he explains, the nuclear family arose due to reforms that the Catholic Church implemented in the early Middle Ages, as well as economic and ideological factors. These new nuclear families, in turn, needed new organizations to provide the services that extended families and clan structures used to provide, fostering the rise of corporate organizations of different purposes. Those corporations tended to think of their own interests as distinct from those of the state and sought to protect them in Europe’s various legal institutions, acting as yet another brake on state power.</p>

<p>In this fascinating podcast episode, Patel interviews David Reich, an eminent geneticist of ancient DNA, about several topics related to early human history and evolution: gene flow between archaic and modern human populations, how early modern humans dominated the world, the impacts of the bubonic plague and of agriculture, the frequent pattern of a group expanding into a territory and wiping out the existing population, etc. Reich is evidently very knowledgeable and eloquent, and he’s also humble enough to readily admit at many times what he doesn’t know. The podcast episode is from August 2024, so it doesn’t go into the findings of Reich’s blockbuster study published in September (and mentioned in <a href="/2024/10/31/links-and-thoughts-010/">my October post</a>), in which he and his colleagues found strong evidence for recent evolution in West Eurasians using a large high-quality dataset of ancient genomes (which they made publicly available).</p>

<p>This article is adapted from McMaken’s lecture delivered at the Albuquerque Mises Circle in New Mexico on September 2024. In it, he explains the importance of private institutions—like families, churches, schools, businesses, and other voluntary organizations—that constitute civil society and function as competitors and bulwarks against the state, and how the state has systematically fought, constrained, and undermined those institutions precisely for that reason. Thus, he argues that libertarians should follow our historical predecessors in not merely opposing the state, but also actively supporting those non-state institutions in our daily work and our daily lives.</p>]]></content><author><name>Samuel Ochoa</name><email>samuelochoap@gmail.com</email></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Origins of modernity, intelligence skewness, American homicide statistics, sigma females, epigenetics, nuclear families, early human history, and why it's not enough to hate the state.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-011.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-011.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Links and Thoughts #10 (October 2024)</title><link href="https://s8a.github.io/2024/10/31/links-and-thoughts-010/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links and Thoughts #10 (October 2024)" /><published>2024-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://s8a.github.io/2024/10/31/links-and-thoughts-010</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://s8a.github.io/2024/10/31/links-and-thoughts-010/"><![CDATA[<p>This month’s compilation brings: an overview of a major study of recent evolution in West Eurasians; a scientific paper detailing the grim outlook for the human gene pool; an article making the case that Christianity reversed cognitive decline in Imperial Rome; an article arguing that immigration in the United States weakens desirable features of federalism; and a podcast episode explaining the nuanced position of Ludwig von Mises on fractional reserve banking.</p>

<p>This article is an overview of the methods, findings, and significance of a recent major study by Harvard geneticist David Reich and his colleagues, which found overwhelming evidence of (relatively) recent evolution in West Eurasians, that is, people who historically lived in Europe, Turkey, and the Caucasus region. Using large amounts of genomic data from ancient West Eurasians spanning 14,000 years, which allowed them to use powerful analytical methods, they found strong evidence of selection for lighter skin pigmentation, lower body fat, less mental illness, and higher intelligence, among other traits. As Kirkegaard explains, these robust findings seem to vindicate the argument of the book <a href="https://a.co/d/6vWhwSk"><em>The 10,000 Year Explosion</em></a> (2009), in which the authors theorize that the development of agriculture and societies with high-density populations led to rapid genetic evolution in humans. Kirkegaard also praised Reich and his team for making their vast, high-quality data set genuinely publicly available, even for non-academics.</p>

</ul>

<p>This is a sobering scientific paper that examines the differences in mutation rates in humans compared to other animals, with a special focus on the largest and most important difference: the fact that humans, through advancements in living conditions, technology, and medicine, have detached ourselves from the challenges of the natural environment and minimized the consequences of many acquired genetic afflictions. The author explains that this has the effect of relaxing selection against mildly deleterious mutations, including those that increase the mutation rate itself, and thus we should expect a long-term deterioration of the average human genetic quality, potentially measurable in just a few generations in advanced economies. The summarized prognosis is grim by itself, but it gets worse when you get into the details.</p>

<p>In this article, anthropologist Peter Frost makes the case that the rise of Christianity reversed the trend of cognitive decline in Imperial Rome by aggressively promoting monogamy, especially among the elite. By forcing men to procreate only with their lawful wife, who was usually of similar status, elite men were no longer having offspring with prostitutes or slave women of lower cognitive ability, and thus they were more likely to pass on the traits that made them successful. Frost also argues that the new faith favored those who were better at learning and following rules while punishing those who weren’t, and this was a secondary factor assisting the rise of cognitive ability. I think the general argument is plausible and convincing, though there are some potential caveats and dissents in the comment section.</p>

<p>In this post, Arctotherium argues that immigration into the United States has dampened or even broken one of the virtues of federalism: the natural experimentation in the different policies enacted in each state and the resulting feedback that citizens provide by moving from and to different states, incentivizing states to copy successful policies that attract and retain residents. He shows the evidence that, absent immigration, Americans overwhelmingly move from Democratic (blue) states to Republican (red) states, specifically because of the more pro-market policies (lower taxes and lighter regulations) of the latter, and that this should tend to move the country rightward. However, he explains, immigration distorts this pattern by propping up the population of blue states and turning red states purple, mitigating the feedback mechanisms that would have incentivized the spread of pro-market reforms.</p>

<p>In this episode, Murphy explains the nuanced position of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises regarding fractional reserve banking. To summarize, Mises favored “free banking,” that is, standard property and contract enforcement on the banking industry without any special requirements or privileges; however, unlike certain prominent free banking advocates today, he thought that this free market arrangement would incentivize very high reserve ratios and thus drastically limit credit expansion. Additionally, Murphy started the episode with a refresher on the different camps in the debate over fractional reserve banking versus full reserve banking and their theoretical arguments, so it’s a decent introduction to the debate in general.</p>]]></content><author><name>Samuel Ochoa</name><email>samuelochoap@gmail.com</email></author><category term="personal" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[West Eurasian evolution, human genetic deterioration, Christianity and cognitive evolution, immigration and federalism, and Mises on fractional reserve banking.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-010.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://s8a.github.io/assets/img/links-and-thoughts-010.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Links and Thoughts #9 (September 2024)</title><link href="https://s8a.github.io/2024/09/30/links-and-thoughts-009/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Links and Thoughts #9 (September 2024)" /><published>2024-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2024-09-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>https://s8a.github.io/2024/09/30/links-and-thoughts-009</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://s8a.github.io/2024/09/30/links-and-thoughts-009/"><![CDATA[<p>This month’s compilation brings: a reflection on the opportunity cost of living an apathetic life, an overview of the well-being gap between progressives and conservatives, a speculative theory on the possible rise of trans-racial dysmorphia, and an exploration of the strange loop between physicality, creativity, and consciousness.</p>

<p>This article is a call to introspection and to action. It’s about a problem that primarily applies to white-collar workers in first-world countries but also applies to different degrees to everyone whose real income is above subsistence level: basically, the inertial tendency to coast through a boring and/or comfortable job (particularly well-paid, low-stress desk jobs) and to live a mediocre, repetitive, boring day-to-day existence for years and decades, until it’s too late. That’s what Raines calls “the apathetic life,” and he emphasizes that the opportunity cost of such a way of living is life itself—our limited time in this world and the foregone challenges, experiences, and achievements that make life worth living. Other authors have addressed this topic before, but I happened to stumble upon the article, and I liked that it explains the issue in such a way that makes you viscerally understand and fear the cost of an apathetic life. The clock is ticking.</p>

  <p>The point of life is to live, and living isn’t a spectator sport.</p>

<p>This essay provides a detailed overview of the ideological well-being gap, its different facets, and the robust evidence supporting it. The ideological well-being gap refers to the fact that conservatives tend to be happier and more well-adjusted than “liberals” (progressives or leftists would be more accurate), a pattern observed both in the United States and other Western countries. Based on the available evidence, the author explains the most likely drivers of the observed patterns, most notably: that there are some genetic/biological factors that simultaneously underlie both ideology and well-being; that conservatism <em>per se</em> may help people cope with adversity; and that some types of leftist ideology <em>per se</em> exacerbate and incentivize unhealthy thought patterns.</p>

<p>This is an intriguing article that argues that trans-racial dysmorphia <sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and trans-racialism <sup id="fnref:fn-2"><a href="#fn:fn-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> will be the phenomena of the next mass identity crisis, after the current one of gender dysmorphia and transgenderism. The author creatively weaves together different phenomena, trends, hypotheses, and tangents to support and elaborate his main thesis that rising narcissism combined with ambiguous or fractured identities is the common root cause of rising transgenderism, trans-racialism, and political polarization. Thus, he argues that the mainstream conservative campaign of fighting against transgenderism by focusing the blame on doctors and pushing for government regulations on them is intellectually lazy and useless at best because it doesn’t address the broader underlying trends.</p>

<p>Overall, a very thought-provoking and well-argued article, though I don’t agree with everything it says. The author also has an unusual and baffling political ideology, which he calls “deep left,” that confused me at first and led me to read several other articles by him to understand his worldview; to summarize, I think “deep left” is kind of a misnomer, but his Substack description is apt: “Progressive, elitist analysis.”</p>

<p>This introspective post by strength training and conditioning coach Cody Lefever, as he explains in the introduction, is primarily his response to the question of <em>why</em> he lifts, though he lays out concepts and lessons applicable in many other areas of life. The article is based on the concept of “strange loops”: according to philosopher and mathematician Douglas Hofstadter, who introduced the concept, “a strange loop is a system that contains a self-referential structure which, when observed at a higher level of abstraction, creates a paradoxical situation.” <sup id="fnref:fn-3"><a href="#fn:fn-3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Lefever explains that physicality, creativity, and consciousness form a strange loop where each element refers to the other two, forming an increasingly complex feedback loop. I highly encourage reading the article; it’s clear, concise, almost poetic, and full of wisdom and inspiration for physical and general self-improvement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The process is the goal. Separating ourselves from doing, for any reason, is the means by which we passively accept eventually not being. Physicality is creativity is consciousness.</p>

<p>This is a long, detailed piece split into three articles that argues against the mutational load hypothesis for the rise of leftism, of which Joseph Bronski is perhaps the strongest proponent. <sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> The mutational load hypothesis has two premises: that mutational load, that is, the accumulation of deleterious mutations, <sup id="fnref:fn-2"><a href="#fn:fn-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> has increased since at least the Industrial Revolution as a result of technological and economic advances, <sup id="fnref:fn-3"><a href="#fn:fn-3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and that mutational load causes leftism; <sup id="fnref:fn-4"><a href="#fn:fn-4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and its conclusion is that increased mutational load is the main, ultimate, or even the sole cause for the almost uninterrupted rise of leftism throughout the world in the last few centuries and especially in the West.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the first part, the author explains the mutational load hypothesis, the strong evidence showing that mutational load has indeed increased in the modern era, and the scarce and weak evidence that it partially causes leftism.</li>
  <li>In the second part, the author shows that even assuming that both premises are correct, the <em>magnitude</em> of the effect of mutational load on leftism cannot plausibly be large enough to explain such a large leftward political shift.</li>
  <li>In the third part, the author analyzes three historical case studies to further demonstrate that mutational load cannot plausibly be the cause of large increases in leftism: the decline of Ancient Rome, the political trends of Quebec and France, and the persistent rightism of breeder cults like Haredim Jews and the Amish.</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, it seems to me that Arctotherium makes a strong case against the mutational load hypothesis, and most likely mutational load is at best a secondary factor in the rise of leftism.</p>

  <li><a href="https://mgautreau.substack.com/p/nice-things-and-why-we-cant-have">Link to article</a></li>

  <li>Source: <em>Bias Confirmations</em> (Substack)</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, Gautreau provides a very interesting and fun to read explanation of the O-ring theory of economic development and its implications. The theory basically explains that some production processes, called O-ring production processes, <sup id="fnref:fn-5"><a href="#fn:fn-5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> have two important distinctive features: the value of the entire product depends on all tasks of the process being completed successfully, and quantity can’t substitute for quality. Gautreau eloquently explains how these features of O-ring production processes result in increasing returns to skill and positive assortative matching for skill levels, and other related interesting implications including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How one person can, intentionally or unintentionally, destroy significantly more value than their labor was worth.</li>
  <li>Why small differences in quality can result in large differences in output and thus wages.</li>
  <li>Why high-skill firms hire higher-quality workers for higher wages even for lower-skill tasks.</li>
  <li>How the quantity of high-skill people in a company or country increases the incentive for investment in human capital.</li>
  <li>How differences in skill levels affect the patterns of specialization, trade, and immigration.</li>
</ul>

<p>The article is a very interesting and accessible read, with many funny and quotable parts. I’ll highlight two of my favorite quotes, one from around the middle of the article, and one from the end:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I repeat myself: life isn’t fair, and man is an unequal creature. Unequal people get unequal incomes, and there’s nothing that will change that.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] The material benefits of this delicate productive arrangement are clear to every enterprise in a capitalist system.</p>

  <p>The challenge is in avoiding the disasters to life, liberty, and property that emerge from skill mismatches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article re-examines the oral polio vaccine (OPV) hypothesis for the origin of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), an alternative to the mainstream-accepted bushmeat hypothesis. The OPV hypothesis claims that HIV evolved from a related virus present in some of the chimpanzee kidney cells used in the large-scale experimental OPV trial carried out in the Belgian Congo from 1957 to 1960. Pallesen argues that there are several improbable coincidences that the bushmeat hypothesis doesn’t convincingly explain, while the OPV hypothesis is straightforwardly plausible, though he makes clear that it might still be incorrect. Furthermore, he provides compelling evidence and arguments that show that the claims used to allegedly refute the OPV hypothesis are either weak or entirely wrong. I particularly liked a brief aside section in which Pallesen highlights the curious parallels between the debate over the origins of AIDS and the debate over the origins of COVID-19. <sup id="fnref:fn-6"><a href="#fn:fn-6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

alt="Chart of the lethality of aggravated assaults in the United States over time, showing that the lethality of aggravated assaults has dramatically decreased due to better medical care and access, thus reducing the homicide rate." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>The central thesis of the article is that while the murder rate is the best proxy we have for the overall crime rate due to its consistent definition and reporting, it’s still necessary to make adjustments to make valid comparisons between eras and regions. In particular, the most important thing to account for is that improvements in medical techniques and access have dramatically reduced the lethality of violent crime throughout the years, and thus the seemingly comparable murder rates in the West between 1960 and the present actually mask the fact that the level of overall crime and disorder is several times higher today. Furthermore, the trends of increasing obesity and wealth, along with improvements in forensics and surveillance technology, should make us expect crime to fall over time, so the deterioration of law and order throughout the years is even more glaring. The second point is that international comparisons must take into account that different countries have different ratios of murders to total crime due to differences in available weapons and the criminal inclinations of their demographics.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the author points out, crime is a relatively simple problem to solve due to the power law distribution of criminal behavior; as a small group of repeat offenders are responsible for the vast majority of crimes, returning to punishing criminals swiftly and harshly would pretty much solve the problem. <sup id="fnref:fn-7"><a href="#fn:fn-7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> I’ll end by quoting the post’s final paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such there’s no good reason European countries today (and ideally the United States) shouldn’t be as safe as Japan. All it would require is a criminal justice system as effective as it was two generations ago. Doing this would be just, make us much wealthier, and vastly improve our quality-of-life. Reaching Japan is realistic and should be the goal of Western criminal justice politics. Accept nothing less.</p>

<p>This article is a thorough statistical analysis of the rise of LGBT identification in the West (particularly in the United States), the factors and trends underlying it, and its implications. The main takeaway is that while there has been an increase in actual non-heterosexual <em>behavior</em> (about 4%), the increase in LGBT <em>identification</em> has been much greater (about 11%), and the data suggests that sociopolitical factors likely explain most of this divergence. Another important takeaway that isn’t surprising at all is that, at least among young people, there is a strong correlation between mental health problems, “liberal” ideology (leftism), and LGBT identity. The article starts with a summary list of the key findings, so I won’t restate them all here. I hope they repeat this report with more recent data.</p>

      <p>Read, for example, <a href="https://www.josephbronski.com/p/how-important-is-the-elite-in-wokeism"><em>How important is the elite in wokeism?</em></a>, a brief article in which Bronski states the mutational load hypothesis as follows: “Leftism is a psychological defect caused by high mutational load induced by the low selection pressures of modernity.”  He provides various graphs and links to studies that purportedly support the hypothesis. <a href="#fnref:fn-1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:fn-2">
      <p>In a footnote, the author clarifies that the technical definition of mutational load focuses on mutations that are deleterious to fitness, but in this case he is referring to “<em>de novo</em> mutations that degrade function (adaption execution) rather than fitness (number of surviving offspring).” Presumably, Bronski is using the term in the same manner. <a href="#fnref:fn-2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:fn-3">
      <p>As the author explains, the increase in mutational load was mostly due to drastically decreased child mortality, which reduces purifying selection, while the other possible cause, increased paternal age, didn’t play a significant role. The author points out that paternal age surprisingly didn’t increase across the board throughout the 20th century. While people in the early 20th century started having children earlier, they also continued to have them for longer, so the average paternal age stayed roughly constant. <a href="#fnref:fn-3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:fn-4">
      <p>In a footnote, the author says that, for the purposes of the article, leftism is defined as “the decay of group-selected behavior,” and he lists the following as indicators of leftism: “Feminism (particularly the decline of absolute monogamy and the loosening of sexual restraints on women), irreligiosity, lowered ethnocentrism, socialism, and promotion of sexual deviancy.” In other words, he defines leftism as anti-civilizational beliefs and behavior, which I find not only amusing but also very accurate. <a href="#fnref:fn-4" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The author’s introductory paragraph summarizes the article perfectly, so I’ll just quote it directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I track the historical rise of West Europe by quantitatively analyzing the birth of notable people of science, and then I put it in context with other indicators of historical development. The data together show that West Europe had developmentally surpassed the rest of the world prior to 1500 A.D., before the establishment of overseas colonies or slavery. It is clear that the West’s rise to global prominence has deeper roots than often suspected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article’s account of the rise of Western Europe is consistent with the argument of libertarian historian Ralph Raico in his essay <a href="https://mises.org/mises-daily/european-miracle"><em>The European Miracle</em></a>. In the essay, Raico explains that the particular reason for Europe’s unprecedented rise was its high degree of decentralization of power and interjurisdictional competition in the Middle Ages, which resulted in few restrictions on private property and commerce, as well as the development of modern market institutions.</p>

alt="Chart of the factor of overrepresentation of Jews in significant figures by area from 1870 to 1950" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This article provides a comprehensive look at data from various sources about the IQ of Jewish people inside and outside of Israel. To summarize, here are the main takeaways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Based on several psychometric test results from the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, where Jews are overwhelmingly Ashkenazim, their average IQ must be somewhere between 110 and 113. This is consistent with Ashkenazi Jews’ overrepresentation in high-IQ professions and achievements.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, Israel is obviously the country with the most Jews, but most of them aren’t Ashkenazim: only about 31.8% of Israeli Jews are Ashkenazim, while 44.9% are Mizrahim, 12.4% are Soviets, 3% are Ethiopians, and 7.9% are mixed. This distribution of Jewish groups, plus the fact that Arabs are about 20% of its total population, explains why Israel’s average IQ, estimated from its PISA performance, is only about 92.</li>

<p>Again, I’ll use the author’s introductory paragraph as the summary for this entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Based on a publicly available dataset, I track the European geographical distribution of notable scientists, philosophers, and other intellectuals from 1000 AD until the Industrial Revolution. Here I give a brief overview of the analysis and then I list the particularly noteworthy individuals within each period.</p>

<p>This essay and corresponding presentation by economist Shawn Ritenour are a reflection and commemoration of <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Human%20Action_3.pdf"><em>Human Action</em></a> (1949), the <em>magnum opus</em> of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of its publication. Ritenour explains the importance of <em>Human Action</em> for economics in general and for his own intellectual career, and how its groundbreaking, rigurously systematic causal-realist approach provides the proper foundations for true economic science, superior to present and past alternative theories.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the latter half of the essay, in which Ritenour provides one of the most readable yet thorough recaps of Mises’s economic theory and its implications for the topic of economic development. I highly encourage reading it from beginning to end, so I’ll just quote the final paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, one of the great lessons of Mises’s Human Action is that the institutions of the free society—private property and sound money—make up the environment enabling economic progress, and hence, human flourishing.</p>

<p>In this article, Arctotherium explains his theory for the rise of modern progressivism/wokeness based on memetic evolution. Basically, industrial prosperity and the rise of mass telecommunications, particularly social media in recent decades, produced an unprecedented memetic environment extremely favorable to memes that spread through “viral” transmission as opposed to “mitochondrial” transmission. Mitochondrial memes, which spread parent to child, tend to produce more functional people and societies than viral memes, which spread peer to peer, because the former tend to go extinct if they make their hosts too dysfunctional, while the latter doesn’t depend on their hosts thriving.</p>

<p>This, the author explains, is the reason wokeness arose and became the dominant ideology of the modern world. This is a severe problem because wokeness is “an ideology that valorizes and promotes every form of human dysfunction, from criminality to stupidity to mental illness to sterility to obesity,” and thus it could eventually bring about the “collapse of civilization, or possibly the extinction of humanity.” The solution, according to the author, would be the rise of a new religion or societal ideology that can replace wokeness, create functional people and societies, and preserve itself.</p>

<p>Briefly, I think modern prosperity and mass telecommunications have definitely played an important role in the rise of wokeness, but I think the author makes a big mistake in not taking into account genetics. More concretely, I think that there’s plenty of strong evidence that moral and political attitudes and other information biases are very heritable, and there’s also a lot of evidence that dysgenics explain a large part of the leftward shift of recent generations.</p>

<p>In this brief article, Bronski explains how and why the concept of “cultural evolution” arose, why it’s deficient and riddled with blank-slatist baggage from its origins, and why the focus should be on the unambiguous concept of “informatic transmission.” In the author’s own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many people give credit to the idea of “cultural evolution.” In this article, I question the validity of the concept of “cultural evolution”, starting with its historical origins. It has mostly served as a [pseudo]-scientific cudgel to advance the aims of blank-slatists. A tour of its first models reveals rampant fallacious reasoning and bad assumptions. The combination of this history, the bad assumptions baked into the concept, and the incoherency of the word “culture” lead me to conclude that the term and its baggage should be abandoned for a better alternative.</p>

<p>The author’s conclusions provide the best summary of the article, so I’ll quote it directly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Immigration has countless effects on locals. It is impossible to enumerate and accurately measure all of them. The obvious way to check if immigration is beneficial or harmful is to see whether locals move towards them or away from them—and revealed preference is that, in Western countries, locals dislike actually-existing immigration so much that they are willing to take large pay cuts to escape it. In immigration-heavy countries, people move away from economic opportunity! This harms the national economy (especially when it is low-skilled Third Worlders driving out locals via behavior rather than housing prices), distorts the immigration debate, and has effectively destroyed one of the biggest pathways for upwards mobility in the 19th and 20th centuries. Internal migration away from productive areas should be a huge screaming red flag signaling to policymakers that the time has come for immigration restriction.</p>

I correctly predicted before the livestream started that the three worst US presidents would be Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lincoln, Wilson, and Roosevelt were all bloodthirsty warmongers and tyrannical centralizers who were arguably the most pivotal in transforming the US government into the Leviathan welfare-warfare state it is today.</p>

<p>Paul Graham, known for being one of the founders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Y_Combinator&amp;oldid=1225221718">Y Combinator</a>, wrote this essay explaining the general recipe for doing great work in any field. Great work takes many forms, but in general, it’s characterized by greatness in ambition and impact; in the best cases, the result is the creation or discovery of an entirely new field. It should go without saying, but Graham explicitly says that his guide is for very ambitious people. The essay contains lots of practical wisdom and motivation—too much to summarize in a sentence or two. However, I think this quote is the best encapsulation of Graham’s recipe for doing great work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.</p>

<p>This essay, by the eminent libertarian historian Ralph Raico, originally appeared in a 1999 book titled <a href="https://store.mises.org/Costs-of-War-P80.aspx"><em>The Costs of War: America’s Pyrrhic Victories</em></a>. Raico provides a critical biography of Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War, citing plenty of high-quality sources. In mainstream history and media, the image of Churchill is that of a hero, a wise strategist, and a principled statesman, widely lauded across most of the political spectrum. Raico’s essay dispels the Churchill myth entirely, exposing him for what he really was: an opportunistic and unprincipled politician, a bloodthirsty and short-sighted war criminal, and one of the godfathers of the destructive Leviathan of the modern welfare-warfare state.</p>

alt="Diagram summarizing the process for producing two-headed planarian worms indefinitely by altering its bioelectric circuit" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This article is an overview of the potentially groundbreaking work of Michael Levin and colleagues in developmental biology. Levin and colleagues’ central claim is that, while genes are still important, higher levels of abstraction and control meaningfully exist in biology; the bioelectric network of the organism is an example of that. It turns out that all cells, not just neurons, produce and sense electric signals in order to coordinate behavior and encode information.</p>

<p>Levin’s lab has demonstrated that the bioelectric network stores anatomical information independently and that it’s possible to modify the structure of an organism just by modulating its bioelectric network, leaving its genes intact. For example, they have induced planarian worms to grow two heads or no heads at all, and frogs to grow extra limbs or even a functional eye in their tail. Beyond the myriad practical applications this research could have in the long run, Levin’s work suggests that the definitions of <em>agent</em>, <em>intelligence</em>, and <em>creativity</em> should be broader, encompassing lower and higher levels of biology in a fractal manner. This is a deep perspective shift that raises some complicated philosophical questions.</p>

alt="Chart of the average number of convictions by offender percentile in Sweden, showing that 1% of the population accounts for 63% of all violent crime convictions." loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>This short article summarizes data from several Western countries, illustrating how a small number of repeat offenders are responsible for a large fraction of the crime. Arrests, convictions, and self-reported delinquent behavior roughly follow power law distributions, in which a few people disproportionately account for most criminal and delinquent behavior. In Sweden, for example, “1% of people were accountable for 63% of all violent crime convictions, and 0.12% of people accounted for 20% of violent crime convictions.” Another example: in New York City, “nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in the city in 2022 involved just 327 people, who collectively were arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.”</p>

<p>In this essay, Hanania explains the concept of gerontocracy, which is basically government policy that systematically favors the old at the expense of the young, and why it came to exist across modern societies. He also explains how gerontocracy manifests in four broad areas of public policy (government spending, credentialism, employment law, and housing), and how this “has in effect made young people poorer, less likely to have families, and in a state of perpetual adolescence.” In light of the “systemic” nature of this “age privilege,” Hanania makes the case for “Critical Age Theory”<sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> as an intellectual movement and proposes the following concrete anti-gerontocratic policies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Less government spending on entitlements that go to old people</li>
  <li>Fewer government subsidies to education</li>
  <li>Occupational licensing reform</li>
  <li>Giving the youth an even playing field in the labor market by abolishing seniority systems and cutting back or eliminating age discrimination laws</li>
  <li>YIMBYism</li>
  <li>Subsidies for families with children</li>
</ul>

alt="Flowchart to determine how strongly does hypocrisy count as evidence against what someone is claiming" loading="lazy" /></p>

<p>In this short article, Caplan elaborates on his answer to the question of whether someone’s hypocrisy regarding a view provides substantive evidence against that view. Caplan argues that this depends primarily on the type of hypocrisy in question:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Normative hypocrisy</em> is when someone’s moral views clash with his behavior. This provides evidence that the person is morally flawed, but it doesn’t provide much evidence that his view is incorrect.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, <em>positive hypocrisy</em> is when someone’s descriptive views clash with his behavior. This does provide strong evidence against the view because it shows that the person himself disbelieves it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Caplan also provides some caveats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we have independent knowledge that the person is <em>extremely morally scrupulous</em>, then normative hypocrisy does provide moderate evidence that his view is incorrect, because it should make us doubt that he actually believes it; of course, it should also make us doubt our previous judgment of his scrupulousness.</li>
  <li>On the other hand, if we have independent knowledge that the person is <em>extremely stupid</em>, then positive hypocrisy provides only weak evidence against the view.</li>
</ul>

      <p>This term is a tongue-in-cheek reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory">critical race theory</a> (CRT), which is basically the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Critical_theory&amp;oldid=1230630780">critical theory</a> to the academic study of race in society, politics, and media. Thus, in concrete terms, CRT seeks to expose, explain, and critique alleged social, political, and legal “power structures” that “oppress” certain races and “privilege” others; it considers that “racism” is systemic to various aspects of those power structures and that it’s not only based on individuals’ prejudices; and it argues that these racial biases are what causes racial disparities in outcomes. Evidently, CRT is a fundamentally leftist (i.e., egalitarian) academic framework, since from the outset it rejects that there are measurable differences in traits or behaviors among different races that result in different group outcomes, or even rejects that races exist as more than “socially constructed” categories that are pretty much arbitrary. To learn more about what races actually are and why they’re not just arbitrary categories, I recommend reading the article <a href="https://noahcarl.medium.com/are-racial-classifications-arbitrary-ac53cb43de90"><em>Are Racial Classifications Arbitrary?</em></a> by Noah Carl. <a href="#fnref:fn-1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

Instead, from the very first post, I wrote summaries that were way too long and elaborated on my opinion in too much detail. It was too time-consuming, and some of the articles turned out way too long.</p>

<p>Thus, I decided to change my approach to what I originally intended, starting with this month’s post, and it was definitely a good decision. In barely a few days of light work, I prepared summaries for the five links in this post and polished the writing for each. I even added highlight images to most of them to liven up the post and perhaps compensate for the reduction in word count. <sup id="fnref:fn-1"><a href="#fn:fn-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I wanted to include three more links in this month’s post, but I got too busy with work to read anything substantial. That’s also why, once again, I posted the article too late. Like I’ve done before, I’ll backdate this article to May 31st and try to do better next time.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here’s what I could gather for May’s post in my “Links and Thoughts” series.</p>

<p>This article goes in depth into the OODA Loop, a decision-making model that the American military strategist John Boyd developed across several presentations he gave throughout the latter half of the 20th century. Nation-states, big and small businesses, and even terrorist organizations now use the OODA Loop as a framework for strategic decision-making. Despite its popularity, the OODA Loop is usually misunderstood and reduced to simply being the four steps of its acronym: Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. Boyd actually conceptualized it as something grander, deeper, more nuanced, and more complex: “an explicit representation of the process that human beings and organizations use to learn, grow, and thrive in a rapidly changing environment—be it in war, business, or life.” The McKays provide an accessible yet detailed synthesis of the philosophical and scientific principles underpinning Boyd’s OODA Loop system, the nuances of each step of the loop, and practical insights for applying it in any domain.</p>

<p>In this article, Cremieux Recueil presents several cases from different regions and time periods that illustrate how elite groups form through processes of selection (both endogenous and exogenous) and thus become genetically different from the rest of the population. The author examines studies and data about the Samurai and Kazoku, the Kulin Brahmin, Egyptian Copts, Jews, and Indo-Fijians, among other cases. The article is very interesting and well-researched; I definitely recommend it.</p>

<p>Inquisitive Bird criticizes both the common view that denies the importance of nature (genetic inheritance) and the opposite view that denies the effect of nurture. In this article, he focuses on the latter claim because others on his “side” of the debate (hereditarians) often assert it, and he thinks it’s not accurate based on the behavior genetics literature. This article summarizes several high-quality studies on the effects of nature and nurture on certain important social outcomes (educational attainment, income, crime, and net wealth) in order to show that parenting does have an important effect on these outcomes, though genetic effects are still roughly twice as impactful.</p>

<p>In this article, Joseph Bronski responds to the Inquisitive Bird article linked above from a hereditarian perspective as well. Bronski confirms that the article’s research is mostly good, and he agrees that, for <em>social outcomes</em>, genetics predominate but the shared environment has a small but measurable effect. However, Bronski provides several important critiques, the main one being that Inquisitive Bird obscures the crucial distinction between social outcomes and physical traits by focusing exclusively on the former, which are intuitively less heritable than the latter. Furthermore, he points out that even for some social traits, parents don’t influence their children at all through the shared environment, only through genes, and some traits show that the non-shared environment (outside the home) has an effect while the shared environment has none; in particular, he provides some charts from his forthcoming book, showing that this is the case for political views on the liberalism-conservatism scale, social attitudes, and moral values.</p>

<p>The secondary critique is that Inquisitive Bird apparently ignored some important limitations of the paper by <em>Isungset et al.</em> (2022). Inquisitive Bird claimed that the paper provides compelling evidence that birth order effects on educational attainment originate in the post-natal environment, but Bronski proposed mutational load as a better explanation. Bronski later edited the article to add some statistical simulations to deal with an objection. He later edited it again to admit his simulations were wrong and to propose an alternative explanation consistent with mutational load theory. I admit I don’t know enough statistics to judge that whole section.</p>

</ul>

<p>This brief article summarizes the evidence that supports the consensus view that hunting (especially big game hunting) is <em>predominantly</em> a male activity in traditional hunter-gatherer societies. The author wrote it as a response to the recent trend of articles and research papers of questionable quality that try to upend our common-sense knowledge of the roles of men and women throughout history. To summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The notion that hunting—particularly large game hunting—is predominantly a male activity in hunter-gatherer society is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. While the strawman that women never engage in hunting isn’t true, the sex differences are even starker than I expected prior to analyzing it. Women hunt regularly in well below 20% of modern hunter-gatherer societies, and they directly capture well below 10% of the hunted meat mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And why do women hunt to a much lesser extent than men? While men’s physical advantages over women certainly play a role, Inquisitive Bird explains that the biggest factor is that only women can breastfeed. In small-scale societies, the average woman would have multiple children, each of which she would have to breastfeed for up to three years, limiting her ability to go on hunting trips or generally face danger, and thus the natural division of labor results in women dedicating themselves to other childcare activities as well.</p>

</ul>

<p>In this article, Brett and Kate outline a general philosophy of household management, inspired by two books: Cheryl Mendelson’s <em>Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House</em>, <sup id="fnref:fn-aom-1"><a href="#fn:fn-aom-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and Aristotle’s <em>Oikonomikos</em>. <sup id="fnref:fn-aom-2"><a href="#fn:fn-aom-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> As they explain, modern people live without <em>context</em> for <em>why</em> they do the things they do, from big things like work, marriage, and having children to smaller things like household management. Thus, the authors sketch out a philosophy to contextualize household management and explain its broader purpose.</p>

<p>The article is relatively short and well-written, so I won’t go into too much detail here, and I highly recommend reading it directly. I’ll summarize the article as follows: The ultimate purpose (<em>telos</em>) of a home is to help the individuals living within it achieve their personal <em>telos</em>. Household management <sup id="fnref:fn-aom-3"><a href="#fn:fn-aom-3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> contributes to this purpose in two ways: it directly develops many virtues or excellences, and it creates a home environment conducive to the development of further excellences. The authors explain the virtues developed by household management and how a well-managed household helps develop further virtues. They conclude by exhorting us to embrace this philosophy and see household management as a means to a nobler end.</p>

</ul>

<p>In this article, “Arctotherium” reviews the 1934 <em>magnum opus</em> of English anthropologist Joseph Daniel Unwin, titled <em>Sex and Culture</em>. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-1"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> First, he provides a comprehensive summary of Unwin’s methodology, model, and findings. Secondly, he applies Unwin’s model to a novel case (Japan) and then to modern Western countries to check that Unwin’s predictions hold up. Next, he compares Unwin’s explanation of his own findings with three alternative explanations that he thinks are much better. Finally, he gives his verdict to summarize his review of the book and concludes by briefly reflecting on the future implications of the book’s findings. I highly recommend reading the article, but I’ll briefly summarize each section.</p>

<p>In the book, Unwin conducted an inductive survey of 80 “uncivilized” societies and six “civilized” societies throughout 5000 years of history. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-2"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> Unwin’s model classified societies based on their rites into four categories that tended to correspond to different levels of cultural achievement, as measured by their “social energy” and their historical memory. “Social energy” refers to a society’s display of those powers that are exclusively human, namely reason, creation, and self-reflection. Unwin also categorized societies based on their sexual opportunity, which is the inverse of the level of sexual restraint they observed. Of course, complex societies have different strata of people, which can fall into different categories; Unwin recognizes this and classifies complex societies by their dominant stratum.</p>

<p>Unwin found a perfect correspondence between the level of sexual restraint and the cultural category of societies; in other words, a positive correlation between cultural achievement and sexual restraint. Most importantly, Unwin found that a decrease in sexual opportunity <em>always</em> leads to greater social energy, and vice versa, though the implications of a change take about three generations to fully manifest themselves. Crucially, however, he found that reducing the sexual opportunity of men only matters if the sexual opportunity of women is at a minimum already. Depressingly, Unwin found that the process by which absolute monogamy is first modified and ultimately abolished is the same in every society; thus, it’s apparently inevitable that societies that become prosperous become increasingly liberal in their sexual morality, resulting in the decay and eventual collapse or conquest of the society due to reduced social energy.</p>

<p>Arctotherium evaluates Unwin’s findings by applying his model to a case that Unwin didn’t know much about, Japan from the Meiji restoration onwards, and concludes that Unwin’s predictions held up. Likewise, he shows that the trajectory of Western countries in the last 60 years or so seems to match Unwin’s predictions: decreasing sexual restraint (Sexual Revolution), particularly of women, has led to decreasing social energy and thus stagnation and decay across many metrics.</p>

<p>Next, he explains why Unwin’s explanation of his own findings is deficient. Unwin, based on then-current Freudian psychoanalysis, provides a straightforward psychological explanation: an inability to satisfy sexual desires causes people to display this frustrated energy as social energy. On top of all the deficiencies of Freudian psychoanalysis, which is now considered outdated, he points out that Unwin’s explanation completely fails to explain the crucial detail that men’s sexual restraint doesn’t matter until women’s sexual restraint is maximized.</p>

<p>Arctotherium then provides three alternative explanations for Unwin’s findings that are much more solid. He included the first two explanations in <a href="https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/the-western-european-marriage-pattern">his article</a> about the Western European marriage pattern, which I featured in my <a href="/2024/01/31/links-and-thoughts-001/"><em>Links and Thoughts</em> #1 (January 2024)</a> post. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-3"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> To summarize, these are his three explanations, which are not mutually exclusive:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Paternal certainty incentivizes men to do great things for their descendants, both in terms of providing a material inheritance as well as a lasting legacy. Only absolute monogamy and absolute polygamy provide absolute paternal certainty, and less sexual restraint for women necessarily implies greater paternal uncertainty. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-4"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> In particular, absolute monogamy is notably superior to absolute polygamy because it produces more cooperation since men don’t have to constantly compete with each other to take each other’s wives or constantly conquer neighboring societies to take theirs.</li>
  <li>Different regimes of sexual restraint incentivize and select for different traits and behaviors, affecting society’s trajectory in the aggregate. The effects on men seem particularly important. Absolute monogamy incentivizes and selects for productive, pro-social traits and behaviors that lead to economic success and great achievements. Absolute polygamy selects for prowess in military conquest and incentivizes men to defect on other men to get more women for themselves. Societies where women have a high degree of sexual choice incentivize intrasexual competition between men and select for attractiveness to women, which includes some good traits but also some unproductive and anti-social traits.</li>
  <li>Female emancipation directly causes both reduced sexual restraint and cultural decline, causing each one through independent mechanisms. A possible way in which female emancipation could cause cultural decline is through greater female cultural influence, considering that women are <em>on average</em> more conformist and sentimental than men. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-5"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> On the other hand, while under absolute monogamy both sexes have to restrain their instincts, <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-6"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> a freer sexual marketplace benefits the average woman much more than the average man, so female emancipation incentivizes women to push for relaxing sexual restrictions. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-7"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>His verdict for the book is that Unwin comes close to his ambitious goal of explaining the universal cause of cultural achievement and decline throughout all of human history. Even though Unwin’s interpretation of his own findings is flawed, his model and his empirical discoveries are sound. He adds that the biggest blindspot in the book is that Unwin doesn’t consider genetics as a factor in human cultural achievement; Arctotherium considers that the book shows that a society’s sex relations explain the <em>direction of change</em> but not the <em>absolute level</em> of its social energy, and that we have abundant evidence that heritable traits like intelligence play a large role in determining a culture’s achievements. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-8"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> His last criticism is stylistic, explaining that Unwin is very verbose and often repetitive; he hopes that a new edition could clean up the style and perhaps expand the analysis to more civilizations.</p>

<p>Finally, in the last section of implications for the future, Arctotherium concludes with good news and bad news based on the book’s findings. The good news is that, apparently, re-establishing absolute monogamy and maintaining it for several generations would solve a lot of big modern problems simultaneously. The bad news is that all societies that attempted to re-establish absolute monogamy failed to do so on time, and more energetic societies conquered them. The glimmer of hope is that two civilizations, the Sumerians and the Anglo-Saxons, successfully re-imposed absolute monogamy <em>after</em> being conquered, and they rose again.</p>

<p>I liked Arctotherium’s summary and review of Unwin’s book. I thoroughly agree with his criticisms of Unwin’s interpretation of his findings, and I think his alternative explanations are much better. I don’t think any major Western country will re-establish absolute monogamy or something close to it any time soon. However, I think there’s at least potential for voluntary separation and concentration of like-minded people in intentional communities in order to live according to traditional sexual norms and marriages and to change local policy to not undermine their lifestyle.</p>

<p>Now, I want to explore some relevant considerations from a libertarian perspective. To start, in the anarcho-capitalist framework, marriages would be private contracts between the spouses that deal with their marriage vows, the management of their property, the custody of their children, conditions for separation, material penalties for breaching the terms of the contract, etc. Like any other contract, a valid marriage contract would require the voluntary agreement of the parties involved (i.e., the prospective spouses). <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-9"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> Furthermore, a binding contract would be defined as one or more transfers of title to alienable property; this means that only transfers of scarce external resources from one party to another would be legally enforceable, not the performance of specific actions. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-10"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Couples would be able to tailor their marriage contract to their particular preferences, with a myriad of possible conditions and arrangements, though of course we can expect that the vast majority of people in a particular region would tend to converge on a sort of standard contract template.</p>

<p>Obviously, this framework is not only compatible with a wide variety of sexual norms and marriage agreements, but it’s actually incompatible with a regime of genuinely <em>absolute</em> monogamy or historically-practiced absolute monogamy. A regime of truly absolute monogamy relegates women to being legal non-entities completely subjugated to their husbands or fathers; in many cases, women had no say <em>at all</em> in choosing who they would marry. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-11"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup> However, a marriage contract could be <em>extremely</em> traditional if the spouses agree to it. Likewise, people could voluntarily live by conservative social mores, enforce these social norms on their property, and form contractual covenants with their like-minded neighbors to enforce these norms in common. Thus, if an anarcho-capitalist community has an overwhelming preference for that type of marriage as well as a culture of absolute monogamy, so to speak, it would have all the desirable practical effects of historically-practiced absolute monogamy.</p>

<p>So, voluntary near-absolute monogamy is possible in anarcho-capitalism, but the question is how common it would actually be; my guess is that only a minority of people would choose to practice it. Let me be clear: I think that modern Leviathan states implement many policies that artificially dilute, distort, and disincentivize marriage and sexual restraint; I also think that repealing these policies would notably improve the status quo and perhaps even reverse the trends of declining fertility and increasing dysgenics. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-12"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Thus, I think it’s reasonable to predict that marriage contracts and social norms would be more traditional than the status quo, but I don’t think that most modern people would choose a <em>very</em> traditional marriage and lifestyle over a more moderate alternative. Based on Unwin’s work, this regime of modified monogamy would not be enough for a society to achieve its highest potential.</p>

<p>If we reasonably assume that most likely only a minority of people would practice near-absolute monogamy, and we also recognize that anarcho-capitalism and right-libertarianism more generally are evidently very unpopular ideologies, what can we do if we want a truly free, flourishing society? Massive cultural change through persuasion alone is very unlikely, for several reasons I won’t go into. An effective long-term strategy requires <em>demographic</em> change—in other words, absolutely monogamous right-libertarians must <em>become</em> the new majority instead of trying to convince the existing majority to be like them. In concrete terms, they must outbreed the population of a (necessarily small) region for several generations.</p>

<p>To summarize, for an anarcho-capitalist society (or something close to it) to emerge and achieve its highest potential, the best long-term strategy seems to be this: smart, absolutely monogamous anarcho-capitalists, or right-libertarians more generally, must intentionally cluster together in a particular region, form parallel private institutions, live according to their traditional sexual mores, and outbreed the general population for several generations. <sup id="fnref:fn-arctotherium-13"><a href="#fn:fn-arctotherium-13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2023/01/smart-fraction-theory-vindicated/">Link to article</a></li>
  <li>Author: Emil O. W. Kirkegaard</li>
  <li>Date: 2023-01-08</li>
  <li>Source: <em>Clear Language, Clear Mind</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, Kirkegaard summarizes the methods and findings of a paper he coauthored with Noah Carl in December 2022, titled <em>Smart Fraction Theory: A Comprehensive Re-evaluation</em>, which is fully available to read for free <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/366691469_Smart_Fraction_Theory_A_Comprehensive_Re-evaluation">at ResearchGate</a>. The purpose of the paper was to statistically test what’s known as “smart fraction theory,” which essentially claims that the cognitive ability of a country’s cognitive elite is generally more predictive than the average ability. Lewis Terman originally proposed the theory in 1916, and some authors mentioned it decades later, but no one quantitatively tested it in a comparative framework until almost 100 years later. According to Kirkegaard and Carl, the handful of quantitative studies on the theory have used inadequate statistical methods.</p>

<p>Kirkegaard and Carl’s study tries to fix the mistakes of previous studies by using a pre-residualization approach in order to properly test the theory against the simpler model of average ability. As Kirkegaard explains, the lower tail and upper tail ability levels are too correlated with the mean ability, so they can’t be directly used in a regression model; residualization solves this by producing a kind of tail deviation score that is uncorrelated with the mean ability and thus can be used together in a regression model. In line with previous literature, they used the 95th percentile IQ score as the benchmark for intellectual-class ability.</p>

<p>I actually found Kirkegaard’s explanation of <em>how</em> residualization works unsatisfactory, and I was left wondering if and how pre-residualization differs from residualization. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-1"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> I’m obviously not an expert in statistics (otherwise, I would’ve known already), but I’m familiar with introductory statistics, so I could handle a more detailed explanation. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-2"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> So I read the actual paper, and it turns out they explained it much better there.</p>

<p>Direct residualization consists of simply subtracting the average from the 95th percentile score, which only produces uncorrelated predictors if the shape of the distribution doesn’t vary across different levels of average ability, as it in fact does. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-3"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Pre-residualization, on the other hand, involves regressing the 95th percentile score on the average score and then using the standardized residuals as predictors. These residuals capture the degree to which the 95th percentile score is higher (positive) or lower (negative) than one would expect based on the average score. The pre-residualization approach is obviously superior, so they mostly focused on that one, though they ran their models again using the direct residualization approach and got pretty much the same results.</p>

<p>Kirkegaard and Carl’s main analysis consisted of predicting the <a href="https://www.socialprogress.org/">Social Progress Index (SPI)</a> general factor using four models with different variables: model 1 included the average score only; model 2 included the average score and the 95th percentile residual; model 3 included the average score and the 5th percentile residual; and model 4 included the average score and both residuals. They found that while average ability by itself is already a good predictor, adding the 95th percentile score to the model appreciably improves it, while adding the 5th percentile score doesn’t really do anything. These findings were statistically significant and are consistent with smart fraction theory.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, they ran their models using tail ability residuals obtained from both pre-residualization and direct residualization, and both approaches yielded pretty much the same results. Furthermore, since it’s widely known that national IQ data shows moderate to strong autocorrelation, <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-4"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> they controlled for the spatial autocorrelation of the SPI by adding a spatial lag for the SPI to the models: the predicted value of the SPI if one were to guess by averaging the SPI of the 3 closest countries. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-5"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> Adding the spatial lag control variable, they found that the standardized coefficients of the original variables decrease somewhat, but the pattern of the result remains the same and is still strong.</p>

<p>The secondary analysis consisted of predicting each of the 40+ component indicators of the SPI using the same approach, and again, they found that the 95th percentile residual has incremental predictive validity over the average ability while the 5th percentile residual doesn’t. Furthermore, they applied the same analysis to predict six economic outcomes and found the same pattern in the results. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-6"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> Finally, they tested the theory on a few other miscellaneous outcomes previously referenced in the literature, this time using only two models (average score only versus average score and 95th percentile residual), and most of their results supported the theory. <sup id="fnref:fn-kirkegaard-7"><a href="#fn:fn-kirkegaard-7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup></p>

<p>To summarize, Kirkegaard and Carl’s study provides comprehensive evidence in favor of smart fraction theory. Kirkegaard concludes his post with some thoughts on his takeaway from the study, which is that society should nurture its best and brightest. He laments that the opposite is happening, at least in Western countries: elite schools and programs are increasingly unpopular; meanwhile, governments waste resources trying and failing to raise the cognitive ability of the bottom 5%. He suggests making sure gifted programs are actually running and implementing universal screening to find all the gifted children to put in them. Obviously, I’m against any government involvement in education, but, as long as it exists, it would be better if it followed Kirkegaard’s recommendations.</p>

</ul>

<p>As the title implies, this article is a general introduction to the science of human biodiversity (HBD), which is nothing more than the straightforward insights obtained from studying humans using the standard lens of natural selection and evolution: namely, that all humans and, by extension, all human groups, are more or less different both physically and psychologically, and that these differences are at least partially genetic in origin.</p>

<p>All of this should be completely obvious and uncontroversial. However, as Winegard points out, most people today strongly reject the idea that human populations are different in socially consequential traits and/or that these differences are even partially genetic. Many people have suffered social and professional consequences for opposing or even questioning the orthodoxy of equality among human groups. <sup id="fnref:fn-winegard-1"><a href="#fn:fn-winegard-1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Furthermore, many academics in relevant fields try to avoid potentially controversial research or whitewash their findings for political correctness; meanwhile, scientific dissenters often find their research blocked from publication or retracted.</p>

<p>Winegard provides a concise yet thorough summary of the HBD position and the evidence for it. He explains the origins of modern human populations, the selection pressures they faced in different regions, how these pressures resulted in different traits, and the strong evidence we have for the heritability of psychological traits, the most controversial insight of HBD. Winegard then provides a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section in which he replies to common questions, objections, and accusations that many people make about HBD and its proponents.</p>

<p>I won’t go into more detail; the article is already concise enough for a general introduction to such a broad topic, and it’s well-written, so I recommend it. I’ll briefly comment on an important detail. Winegard notes that many or most modern people seem to hold as a sacred moral value the conviction that all human populations are equal in that they have roughly the same distribution of socially valued traits, and that’s why they have such a strong, unthinking rejection of HBD despite all the evidence. I’ll add that this is just a manifestation of egalitarianism, the false and destructive ideology or moral bias that has come to dominate the modern world. As Murray Rothbard argued in a 1973 essay, egalitarianism is a “revolt against nature” and against the structure of reality itself, and there’s no logical reason to presuppose that equality is inherently desirable or a moral imperative. <sup id="fnref:fn-winegard-2"><a href="#fn:fn-winegard-2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>

  <li>Source: <em>Aporia Magazine</em> (Substack)</li>
</ul>

<p>This article concisely explains the evolutionary reasons for the traits that men and women find attractive and provides links to published research that supports each hypothesis. Many say that beauty is entirely subjective, but, as Garnås explains, this doesn’t make sense from an evolutionary perspective. One would logically expect there to be some universal markers of beauty related to what matters for reproductive success, and indeed, scientific evidence suggests that is the case.</p>

<p>I think everyone who is honest and thinks about it for a few seconds already knows that it’s obvious that beauty is to a great degree objective, or intersubjectively ascertainable with near universal agreement, though of course personal and cultural factors also influence each individual’s specific preferences.</p>

<p>The article is relatively short, well-written, and links to research to back its statements, so I highly recommend reading it, and I won’t restate each of his points. Instead, I’ll just quote the author’s conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like all species, we are designed by natural selection to preserve and propagate our genes. By choosing a partner with nice skin, hair and teeth, symmetrical features, good posture and movement patterns, and a lean physique, we are inadvertently selecting for microbial, hormonal, musculoskeletal, nutritional and immunological health. This, in turn, enhances our reproductive success by enriching our life and endowing our offspring with beneficial characteristics.</p>

  <p>Physical beauty isn’t just something we find pleasing; it’s a matter of survival and reproduction.</p>

      <p>The distinction between civilized and uncivilized societies is not a key portion of Unwin’s model, and he himself says that it’s just a rough, arbitrary classification. Unwin defined “civilized” societies as the following: <em>“Sumerians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Hellenes, Persians, Hindus, Chinese, Japanese, Sassanids, Arabs (Moors), Romans, Teutons, and Anglo-Saxons (i.e. ourselves).”</em> The six “civilized” societies that Unwin chose to study were the Sumerians, Babylonians, Hellenes, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and English, with a few comments about the Arabs and Moors. Unwin explains that he limited his survey to those societies for which he had reliable evidence, and he encourages the reader to check if his findings hold for other societies using alternative measures. <a href="#fnref:fn-arctotherium-2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:fn-arctotherium-5">
      <p>Even if the difference is apparently small <em>on average</em>, we know that men have greater variability in many traits than women.

      <p>Arctotherium encapsulates the sexes’ natural instincts perfectly in a footnote, which I’ll quote directly: <em>“Men’s instincts tend towards polygamy, having sex with many women at the same time, ideally with exclusive sexual access and always retaining the option to branch out further. Women’s instincts tend towards hypergamy, having sex with the most attractive man, ideally while receiving investment (not necessarily from the same man) and always retaining the option to trade up.”</em> Absolute monogamy restrains both sexes’ instincts in a socially beneficial equilibrium. <a href="#fnref:fn-arctotherium-6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>This effect is even more important now because modern contraceptives are widely available and effective, massively reducing the risk for a woman that a sexual encounter would result in her pregnancy. This has contributed to reducing women’s incentives for sexual restraint and judiciousness in selecting a partner.

      <p>It should be obvious, but I’ll clarify that, for this consent to be legally valid, both prospective spouses would have to be adults with enough mental capacity to independently understand and agree to the terms of the contract, as well as the nature and activities inherent to a marital relationship.

      <p>For some time now, I’ve been thinking that something along these lines is the best and possibly the only realistic strategy to create a libertarian society. Many libertarian authors have advocated intentional geographical clustering of liberty-minded people, parallel voluntary institutions, secession, and similar strategies, so I was already familiar with and sympathetic to those strategies. Notably, the <a href="https://www.fsp.org/">Free State Project</a> is a real-world movement with the goal of getting libertarians to concentrate in New Hampshire to turn the tide against government there; despite not yet reaching the original libertarian population target, they’ve already achieved a noticeable, though not major, influence on the state’s politics. In the past six months or so, I’ve been reading many articles on sociobiology, and I’ve integrated many insights from them into my worldview, adjusting my expectations and opinions on strategy accordingly. Incidentally, I recently read the article <a href="https://www.josephbronski.com/p/the-extinction-of-the-dark-elves"><em>The Extinction of the Dark Elves</em></a> by Joseph Bronski, in which he elaborates a strategy, similar to the one I propose, for “dark elves” (right-wing, fit, high-IQ, white people) to cluster in a particular region, voluntarily practice traditional marriage unrestricted, reproduce, and flourish; the main differences are that he is not a libertarian, his criteria for belonging to his desired hypothetical community are too strict in my opinion, he completely excludes non-whites, and he supports widespread embryo selection while I have ethical concerns about it. <a href="#fnref:fn-arctotherium-13" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>Part of my confusion was that I originally understood that they calculated the “tail deviation scores” by simply subtracting the average from the 95th percentile score, which would obviously produce only positive values. However, the map he included in the article showed zero and negative values. Once I read the paper, I realized that my initial understanding corresponded to the inferior direct residualization approach, while the map corresponded to the more sophisticated pre-residualization approach. <a href="#fnref:fn-kirkegaard-1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I’m referring to the title essay in <a href="https://mises.org/library/book/egalitarianism-revolt-against-nature-and-other-essays"><em>Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature, and Other Essays</em></a> (1974, 2nd ed.). My favorite quote: <em>“The egalitarian revolt against biological reality, as significant as it is, is only a subset of a deeper revolt: against the ontological structure of reality itself, against the “very organization of nature”; against the universe as such. At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will—in short, that reality can be instantly transformed by the mere wish or whim of human beings.”</em> <a href="#fnref:fn-winegard-2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
